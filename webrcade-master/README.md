WebЯcade consists of an intuitive [web-based front end](https://docs.webrcade.com/userguide/) that enables playing popular gaming content entirely within the context of the browser across a [wide variety of platforms](https://docs.webrcade.com/platforms/) (Xbox Series X|S, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS). Gamepads are supported (Bluetooth and USB) for both front-end navigation and while playing games.

The content for playing games (binaries, etc.) and populating the front-end (images, etc.) is collected from [cloud-based resources](https://docs.webrcade.com/feeds/resources/) based on [user-defined feeds](https://docs.webrcade.com/feeds/). Each feed item (game, etc.) has an associated application type. [Application types](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/) include [emulators](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/emulators/) (Atari, Sega, Nintendo) and [game engines](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/engines/) (Classic Doom).

## Documentation

The [webЯcade Documentation](https://docs.webrcade.com/) consists of a [User Guide](https://docs.webrcade.com/userguide/), instructions specific to each [Platform](https://docs.webrcade.com/platforms/) (OS, devices) supported by webЯcade, detailed information (button mappings, etc.) for the various [Application Types](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/) (emulators, etc.), and guidance for developing your own [Feeds](https://docs.webrcade.com/feeds/).

The following steps are recommended for getting started with webЯcade:

* Review the [User Guide](https://docs.webrcade.com/userguide/) in order to familiarize yourself with the webЯcade front-end.
* Read the documentation for the [Platform](https://docs.webrcade.com/platforms/) (OS, device) you will be using with webЯcade to learn platform-specific details such as how to optimize the experience and how to connect gamepads.
* Review the documentation for each [Application](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/) that is launched to determine its keyboard and gamepad mappings as well as any other application-specific notes (an application is the emulator or engine being used to play a particular game, etc.).

## Default Feed

The default feed consists of high-quality publicly available games and demos across the various [application types](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/) ([emulators](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/emulators/), [engines](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/engines/), etc.) that are supported by webЯcade.

The [default feed AUTHORS page](https://github.com/webrcade/webrcade-default-feed/blob/main/AUTHORS-default-feed.md) includes the list of titles that are included in the default feed, their respective authors, and related links. 

## What is (and is not) webЯcade?

The following lists further describe webЯcade in terms of its focus.

**Primary focus:**

* Runs entirely within the web browser leveraging JavaScript, WebAssembly, and the HTML5 gamepad and audio interfaces
* Adaptive user interface that supports a [wide variety of platforms](https://docs.webrcade.com/platforms/) (Xbox Series X|S, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS)
* Native gamepad support (Bluetooth and USB) for both front-end navigation and while playing games
* [User-defined cloud-based feeds](https://docs.webrcade.com/feeds/) identify the resources (images, etc.) required to populate the front-end as well as the content (binaries, etc.) required to play games
* Each feed item (game, etc.) has an associated application type. [Application types](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/) include [emulators](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/emulators/) (Atari, Sega, Nintendo) and [game engines](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/engines/) (Classic Doom). The quantity and types of applications will continue to expand over time.

**Not focused on:**

* Directly playing locally stored game content (ROMs, etc.)<br>*(Technically possible by using a local web server, but not a primary use case)*
* The "latest and greatest" emulator features and compatibility<br>*(Primary emphasis is on compatibility with popular game content across a variety of platforms while minimizing resource requirements)*
* Touch-based (virtual) gamepad controls<br>*(The focus is on native gamepad support via Bluetooth and USB)*
