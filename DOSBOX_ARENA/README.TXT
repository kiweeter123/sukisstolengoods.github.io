	       ADDENDA AND ADDITIONAL NOTES ON TES:ARENA
	_______________________________________________________

1.	KEYBOARD CONTROL:
	There is keyboard control implemented for TES:Arena. The arrow
	keys control forward/backward movement and turning left or right.

2.      ARTIFACT QUESTS:
	Artifact quests can be received by asking people for "General 
	Rumors". The chance of receiving a quest increases as a function
	of your level.

3.      CLASS BALANCE: 
	In Arena, not all classes are equally powerful and, consequently, 
	different classes will require different techniques to complete 
	the game.
	
	The subtleties of character classes is up to you to discern.
	Nevertheless, if you find the game play too hard, you might 
	consider changing your character class. While each character 
	class has its own unique abilities, Spellcasting classes are 
	generally more powerful than non-spellcasting classes. Each 
	class however, has the ability to complete the game successfully.

4.    	BUGS/HARDWARE INCOMPATIBILITIES:
	We have spent literally thousands of hours testing TES:Arena.
	We are very aware that with any program as large as Arena however, 
	there may be some bugs lurking undiscovered. If each user will take 
	the time to let us know of any problems they encounter, we will be 
	in a position to make the necessary corrections and post them on 
	the various BBSs. This way, any remaining problems can be corrected 
	quickly. To contact our BBS call (301) 990-7552. For other contacts,
	please refer to your Player's Guide.
	
	NOTE: We have determined some hardware incompatabilities with 
	certain Packard Bell systems. Some of these machines are quite 
	simply not 100% IBM compatible. This often manifests itself as 
	stray pixels on the health, fatigue and spell point bars, although 
	other symptoms may also occur. This is NOT related to the software.

5.	INSTALLATION: Context-sensitive help files:
	If the context sensitive help messages on Disk 1 do not
	highlight the appropriate item selected, complete the full
	installation and try again.  

6.	OTHER:
	Once you receive a clue as to a staff piece location, you can ask
	people where that location might be by asking "Where is...". The 
	place name (such as Fang Lair) will be found at the bottom of the
	picklist, ie... you need to scroll the list down to see it.

7.	NEW FUNCTION KEY ASSIGNMENT: 
	(For DX 66 VESA Local Bus owners experiencing quadrant shear effect)

	The F3 key now toggles between one of three modes for
	registering hits in combat. 
	Normal Roll: This is the default which simulates a blow to the head.
	Heavy Roll:  Lessens shear effect to improve roll stability.
 	No Roll:     Self Explanatory - The screen will flash red
		     when you are hit.

	For optimal effect on your system toggle between these modes.
