You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
fine trappings and furniture
that decorate the area. A cool
breeze wafts through the area,
drying the sweat from your body
and bringing a welcomed sigh to
your lips. You relish in the
brief respite. Ahead of you
waits %rf, %t of %cn. It is well
known that %cn is currently at %st with its
neighbor, %cn2.&

Outside the sun batters
relentlessly on the citizens of
%cn, but in the audience chamber
of %rf, %t of the %ct, the
shadows are deliverance. The
rewards of power and wealth
decorate the room. Obviously,
being at %st with the %ct's
neighbor, %cn2, has been
profitable for the %t of %cn.
Perhaps you too can benefit from
this situation...&

You enter the audience
chamber of %rf, %t of %cn.
Despite the season, not a warm
ray of sunshine has touched this
room. You breath in the musty
air and wipe the sweat from your
brow as you wait for the %t to
finish business with some
messengers from %cn2, %cn's
neighbor. The behavior between
the %t and the messengers is
peculiar, considering the two
have been at %st for some time...&

#0000b
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
fine trappings and furniture
that decorate the area. Outside
you can still hear the raindrops
as they fall, soaking everything
in sight and creating a humid
haze which causes your clothes
to cling to you like a second
skin. Ahead of you waits %rf, %t
of %cn. It is well known that
%cn is currently at %st with its neighbor, %cn2.&

You enter the audience
chamber, wiping the warm water
of the summer rain off of your
face. At the center of the
opulently decorated room, %t %rf
is speaking with the %ct
councilmen of %cn. You overhear
them mention %cn2, their
neighbor to the %di, with which
%cn is at %st.&

Like an unwanted dog, the
steam from the hot summer
drizzle has followed you to the audience chamber of %rf, %t of
%cn. They whisper,
but you think you hear one of
the counselors remind the %t
that they are at %st with %cn2, the
%ct's neighbor to the %di.&

#0000c
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
fine trappings and furniture
that decorate the area. Even
though the clouds outside have
made everything seem dull and
gray, you find that the interior
is brightly lit and cheerful.
Ahead of you waits %rf, %t of
%cn. It is well known that %cn
is currently at %st with its
neighbor, %cn2.&

You enter %t %rf's audience
chamber, finding the %ct elders
in conference with the %t. The
mood in the room reflects the
weather outside; hot and dark
with rain clouds. The elders
continue to whisper nervously
one to the other.&

The audience chamber of %t
%rf of %cn is alive with
activity. The %t and an elder
discuss a discontented local
group who wish %cn no longer to
be at %st with its neighbor,
%cn2. %g next turns attention to
a merchant whose shop is under suspicion of housing a
Thieves' Guild...&

#0000d
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and
furniture that decorate the
area. Outside the golden fall
sun lends its warmth, holding
back winter's hand for a few
moments more. Ahead of you waits
%rf, %t of %cn. It is well known
that %cn is currently at %st with
its neighbor, %cn2.&

It is the busiest season of
the year in %cn, and the
palace's audience chamber is
filled with area farmers
discussing their harvests with
%t %rf. Many linger in the room
after their business is through,
procrastinating the return to the burning
field work. They
seem to be talking mostly about
%cn being suddenly at %st with its nearest neighbor,
%cn2, and how this will
change the trade throughout the province.&

It is unusually warm for the
autumn in %cn, but the audience chamber of %t %rf
reflects little of the
sunshine outside...&

#0000e
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber shaking the
cold rain from your shoulders.
The first thing you notice is
the many fine trappings and
furniture that decorate the
area. The warm air serves to
quickly dry you from the fall
shower outside. Ahead of you
waits %rf, %t of %cn...&

You had hoped that the
chamber of the %t of %cn would
provide relief from the cold
autumn rain outside, but it is
as damp and chilly as a
mausoleum. Others seeking
audience wait with dripping hair
and chattering teeth, as %t %rf
talks with a representative from
%cn2, the %ct's neighbor that
%cn is at %st with...&

It has been an uncomfortably
warm autumn in the %ct of %cn,
so the recent shower has
actually improved the mood in
the audience chamber of %t %rf.
You know that %cn2, %cn's temperamental neighbor, is only
recently at %st with %t %rf, but
foreign diplomacy is not being discussed among the %t and the
circle of counselors.&

#0000f
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and furs
that decorate the area. Even
though autumn's clouds outside
have made everything seem cold
and gray, you find that the
interior is brightly lit and
warm. Ahead of you waits %rf, %t
of %cn. It is well known that
%cn is currently at %st with its neighbor, %cn2.&

You enter %t %rf's audience
chamber, shaking the chill of
the gray autumn day from your
skin. Being currently at %st with
its neighbor %cn2, the leading citizens of %cn have met to
discuss the resultant
implications with their %t...&

As you enter the audience
chamber of the %t of %cn, you
feel the autumn chill from the
outside is actually intensified within. The thick furs and
darkly beautiful ornaments that decorate the walls make you
feel as if you're being watched. %t
%rf looks up from the conference
%g is having with the council of elders...&


#0000g
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and warm
furs that decorate the area.
Even though the sun outside is
strong, winter's hand has
chilled you to the bone. You
find that you welcome the
brightly lit and warm interior.
Ahead of you waits %rf, %t of
%cn...&

You enter the audience
chamber of %t %rf of the %ct of
%cn, lips chapped from the cold,
flesh burned by the sun. Representatives from %cn2,
meeting with the %t, leave the
room as you enter. It appears
not to have gone well, for the
council of elders and %t %rf seem
to be in a sour mood...&

%t %rf's audience chamber is
alive with excitement. %cn and
%cn2, the %ct's neighbor to the
%di, are at %st talks. Naturally,
this has caused a lot of the
internal stress within %cn. The
%t is remarkably calm, hearing
each of the citizen's concerns
about trade and commerce...&


#0000h
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and warm
furs that decorate the area. You feel your
frozen limbs begin to
thaw in the warm heat of the
brightly lit interior. You
welcome the brief respite from
the cold. Ahead of you waits %rf,
%t of %cn...&

The audience chamber of %t
%rf is drier than the snowy
streets of %cn, but not any
warmer. You rub your hands
together and watch your breath
come like smoke from a chimney...&

Your eyes, squinting from
the glare of the snow outside,
grow accustomed to the gloom of
%t %rf's audience chamber.&

#0000i
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and warm
furs that decorate the area. The freezing temperature and
iron gray clouds outside have made everything frozen and dull,
though you find that the
interior of this chamber is
brightly lit and cheerful. Ahead
of you waits %rf, %t of %cn...&

Frozen to the core, you
stumble into the audience
chamber of %t %rf, only to feel a
chill that pierces your soul.
The room itself is physically
warm and pleasing to the eye, but
you sense an undercurrent of tension...&

You are admitted into the
presence of the good %t of the
%ct of %cn. A thick cloak of
wolf hide is gently wrapped
around your shoulders, and as
feeling returns to your skin,
you feel that parts of your face
were dangerously close to
frostbite...&

#0000j
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and
expensive furniture that
decorate the area. The warm
spring air wafts through an open window, bringing along with it the
scent of newly budding
flowers and fresh green grass.&

It is hard to believe that
anyone can think of politics on
such a day, but people are
lining up to be heard by %t %rf
while outside newly bloomed
flowers perfume the air...&

Inside the audience chamber
of %rf, %t of %cn, the new
sprouts of spring die young and
the perfume of the fresh blossom
turns to a sickly stench.
%rf is rumored to have angered the %ct
oracle who placed upon the %t a
curse of poor health. The
political change has been very noticeable in such a %ct
where tradition is of highest
importance...&


#0000k
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and
expensive furniture that
decorate the area. The warm
spring shower has left you
pleasantly refreshed, if a bit
wet, but a breeze seems to be
blowing through here and you
feel yourself dry quickly...&

For an agriculture-based %ct
like %cn, a good spring rain
makes all the difference during
the seeding. Everyone seems in a
good mood, and the preparations
for the traditional new year celebrations is the
conversation on all lips...&

Through an open window in
the audience chamber of %t %rf,
you can smell the spring rain
and newly blossomed flowers out
in the streets of %cn. The floor
is wet with the tread of many visitors...&

#0000l
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and
expensive furniture that
decorate the area. The day has
been overcast, iron gray clouds
that hint of a spring storm. You
find yourself welcoming the
sun's return. Ahead of you waits
%rf, %t of %cn. It is well known
that %cn is currently at %st with
its neighbor, %cn2.&

The government of %cn is
like the weather outside,
pleasantly temperate but dark
with clouds threatening
catastrophe. In the audience
chamber of %t %rf no one even
whispers their theories about
the ulterior motives behind the
%ct's recent declaration of %st
with its neighbor, %cn2.&

You like the looks of the
audience chamber of %rf, %t of
%cn the moment you enter.
Beautiful music rings through
the room and the walls hang with
rich tapestries of spring scenes
much nicer than the gray day
outside...&

#0015
I am disappointed, but
understand that a young adventurer's
schedule is hard to break. I see
you are doing well now. I hope
good fortune smiles upon your efforts...&

I had hoped you would be
interested, but there
are others who would gladly
welcome the chance to fill their purses. I thank you but
must turn my attention to other
matters. Good luck on your
travels...&

You would deny a pleading %t a
small request such as this! Away
with you then, for I have more important matters to consider
than some amateur %ra adventurer
Begone!...&

Well, I am not particuliarly
surprised that you refuse this possible adventure for I have
heard that young %ra people like you are notoriously
unambitious. I hope you are able to do something
of some value elsewhere. Leave me now.&

I understand. There would be
some risk in accepting my
quest, and that naturally makes
you nervous. Very well, young %ra.
You will forgive me if I do not
walk you to the door. Goodbye.&

Very well, I cannot force
you to accept my plea. I hope all
goes well in your travels, and you return to
%cn someday. Now you may go. I
will find someone else eager
to help a %t and become rich.
Fare you well.&

What a pity. I will have to
find another champion. Good
day, %pcn. I wish you well.&

I suppose I cannot talk you
into it. Perhaps there is another
who will accept the risks in return for wealth and fame.
Farewell, good %ra.&

#0001a
You wipe the sweat off your
brow as you enter the Mages
Guild. The cool shade of the
interior is a welcomed sight
after standing under the harsh
summer sun. Around you are arcane implements and mystical
apparati.
You feel a slight tingling on your skin.&

For a moment after leaving
the bright summer sunshine, your
eyes register only darkness in the gloomy Mages Guild. When
they
adjust, you can understand very
little of what you see. Tomes of antiquated wizardry and
obscure objects crowd the dusty shelves.&

The door to the Mages Guild
opens with a puff of dust that
sticks to the sweat on your
sunburned face. The smells of sulfurous potions burning and
ancient scrolls of moldering
parchment sting your nose. At least
it is cool in here, you say to yourself.&

#0001b
You shake the rain from your
shoulders as you enter the Mages Guild. The dry interior is a
welcomed sight after standing in
the downpour outside. Around
you are arcane implements and
mystical apparati. You feel a
slight tingling on your skin.&

The sound of the warm summer
rain is muffled by the thick walls
and thicker velvet curtains. This
is a place where the outside world
is a distraction to be avoided.
The smells, sights, and sounds
here are unique to the field of mystical experimentation.&

You enter the Mages Guild,
avoiding the puddles of
rainwater leaking under the door.
The room is damp, but the thick
stone walls keep it cool even
in the dog days of summer. Strange devices and venerable
tomes crowd across the dust and soot streaked shelves.&

#0001c

You enter the Mages Guild,
its gloomy interior not much
different from the iron-gray,
overcast sky outside. At least,
you silently think, the sun isn't
out. Around you are arcane
implements and mystical apparati.
You feel a slight tingling on
your skin.&

All the humidity and heat of
the day are intensified in the
Mages Guild. To add to the
infernal atmosphere, tendrils of soot-filled smoke and the
whimpers from some doomed
experiment slip through the cracks
of locked doors. Each book on the shelf looks like it is
watching
you.&

You enter the Mages Guild,
an amalgamation of primordial
relics, moldering scrolls, dripping unguents, and smoking
fluids. An occasional groan or minor
explosion can be heard coming
from the laboratories. At least
it's not as hot and humid as
outside.&

#0001d
Behind you the fall sun
sheds warmth upon the land,
holding back the icy fingers of
winter yet another day. Around you
are arcane implements and
mystical apparati. You feel a
strange tingling on your skin.&

While the local farmers have
been gathering their crops, it
would appear the mages have been collecting a harvest of their own. The
Mages Guild is crowded with scrolls, relics, charms, and artifacts. Clearly
some extensive trading between one town's guild to another's has been going
on
this fall.&

You enter the Mages Guild, a
world where nature holds
little power. Outside leaves are falling and plants are dying back
into the ground, but in here,
strange flora lives year round, competing for space next to the
scrolls, potions, and other
mystic apparati that crowds the Guild's shelves.&

#0001e
You shake the cold rain from
your shoulders as you enter the
Mages Guild, stamping your feet
to bring back some warmth. The dry interior is a welcomed
sight
after standing in the icy
downpour outside. Around you are arcane implements and
mystical apparati. You feel a slight
tingling on your skin.&

The Mages Guild is dry, but
no more welcome that the cold
autumn tempest outside. Strange
and exotic potions, ancient
scrolls, and arcane relics
look down at you from the shelves
as if they are predatory birds, watching for you to make a
mistake. The dark energy in the
room goes through you like a
charge.&

All along the walls of the Mages Guild, blackened with soot and
neglect, are shelves of books
and arcane apparati so cloaked in
dust to be practically indistinguishable one from the
other. You can hear the sound of
the fall cloudburst outside, uncomfortably loud in the normally
still little room.&

#0001f
You enter the Mage's Guild,
its gloomy interior not much
different from the cold, overcast
sky outside. At least, you
silently thank, the interior is
warm. You rub your hands together
to bring back some feeling.
Around you are arcane implements
and mystical apparati. You feel a strange tingling on your
skin.&

On a dark cool day like
today, those who devote their
lives to the mystical sciences are
at their busiest. Outside,
people look into the sky and view
the coming winter with dread. All
in the Mages Guild are as
active with mystic energy as they might be on any day,
including the books and relics that line the shelves.&

You enter the Mages Guild,
going from a cool gloomy outside
to a cool gloomy inside. Because
of the shadows, you cannot see all that the chamber contains -you suspect
that even by the light
of a bright day, the room has its secrets. Potions, relics, and books
line the bookshelves
shrouded by a fine dust.&

#0001g
The sun outside has done
little to warm your bones,
which are now almost frozen. You
enter the Mages Guild, stamping
your feet and crowding close to
a brazier that glows hot with
fiery coals. As the warmth slowly seeps in, you notice
arcane
implements and mystical apparati.
You think you feel a strange
tingling on your skin.&

As sunny as it was, you felt
a winter chill outside and now,
within the Mages Guild, you feel
the cold more intensely. Dust
lies on the shelves of books,
potions, and relics like an early frost. The stone walls of the
chamber glisten with ice.&

The melancholy Mages Guild
is slightly warmer than the winter
day outside but, without the
sunlight, the effect is much the
same. Many books and arcane instruments lie scattered about, but
they fail to lend any vitality to the scene. It is a place of
mystical study, not built
for human comfort.&

#0001h
Snow and wind swirl about
you as you enter the Mages
Guild and shut the door. Outside
the winter snow falls without
any signs of stopping. You stamp
your feet and crowd close to a
brazier that glows hot with fiery coals. As the warmth
slowly seeps in, you notice arcane
implements and mystical apparati.
You think you feel a strange
tingling over your skin.&

The white dust in the Mages
Guild is not as deep as the
snow outside, but it is so
omnipresent that all the arcane
relics within seem to be covered in
a thin shroud. It is an almost soundless chamber, with only an
occasional sigh from the pot of boiling liquid on the fire. Slowly
warmth creeps back into your
chilled body.&

You enter the dim Mages
Guild, warmed by a spell that
dries the snow from your face and
hair almost immediately. Books, charms, scrolls, and other
relics, older than human memory,
are kept in pristine condition
here by the same mystic energy.&

#0001i
The gray sky has done little
to warm your bones, which by
now are almost frozen. You enter
the Mages Guild, stamping your
feet to increase the
circulation and crowd close to a brazier that glows hot with
fiery coals. As the warmth slowly
seeps in, you notice arcane
implements and mystical apparati.
You think you feel a strange
tingling on your skin.&

It is a perfect day for
those who practice the shadowy
arts: the Mages Guild comes most
alive on cold, dark winter days. Cauldrons bubble on the fireplace,
filling the room with translucent smoke that smells of animal fat and
sulfur. The shelves are cluttered with mystical books and artifacts...&

You know that you can only
see half of what is in the
Mages Guild. The titles of the
books on the shelves seem to
change depending on the angle you look. Invisible fingers run
through the dust and over your face.
From the corner of your eye, you
can see demons grinning at you, but they vanish when you turn to
look
at them. As dark a winter day
as it is outside, you want to do
your business here and leave...&

#0001j
A cool breeze follows you
into the Mages Guild, drying the slight sheen of sweat from
your
brow. The interior smells of
spices and chemicals. As your
eyes adjust to the dim light you
can make out arcane implements
and mystical apparati. You think
you feel a strange tingling on your skin.&

You enter the Mages Guild,
the smell of sulfur and
rotting parchment replacing that of new spring blossoms.
Scrolls and potions, relics and artifacts
vie for space on the bookshelves.
You can hear small living things scuttling behind the
volumes of
alien encyclopedia.&

The mystical energy in the
Mages Guild runs through you
like a charge of lightning. Outside nature is in her full
vernal glory
on this sunny day, but she has
little power in here. From the
stone walls to the scrolls and potions, the most mundane parts of
this chamber seem like phantasmagoria.&

#0001k
You shake the warm rain from
your shoulders, conscious of the pooling
water at your feet. As
your eyes slowly adjust to the dim interior, you can make out
arcane implements and mystical apparati. You think you feel a
strange tingling on your skin.&

As thick as the stone walls
of the Mages guild are, you can
hear virtually every splatter of
the spring rain outside. You are almost afraid to talk, for every
echo of each footstep causes great clouds of dust to billow. And
there are books and apparati in this
room, you suspect, that should
never be disturbed.&

An open window in the Mages
Guild lets in the smell of the
spring storm, which mingles with
the chemical stench that bubbles
from an open cauldron. The
chamber is filled with arcane
objects, jugs, cloaks, scrolls, amulets, tomes, brooches,
potions, robes, figurines, talismans.&

#0001l
Although the sky is gray the
weather itself is pleasant. You
can smell rain in the air, but that quickly changes as the
door shuts behind you. The Mages Guild
smells like old spices and
chemicals. You can make out dozens
of arcane implements and mystical apparati. You think you feel a
strange tingling on your skin.&

You enter the Mages Guild
from the gloomy spring day and are struck by the clutter. You know
that wizardry is a mental art, and
it is hard to believe the
sorcerers behind this jumble of
items and apparati are not either madmen or fools. You can
definitely hear small living things move about in the piles.&

The Mages Guild is not a
place where the normal gods of
Nature hold reign, but on such a
bleak spring day, it does not look like they have power
anywhere.
Somehow the chamber is
simultaneously too hot and too
cold, wet with humidity in one
spot, drier than the Khajiit desert
in another. Even the mystical items
on the shelves are juxtaposed
between extremes, ancient scrolls
next to modern measuring
devices, this one filthy with
neglect, that polished with
care.&

#0002a
Cool shade and cooler drinks
greet you as you make your way
out of the heat and into the %nt, smiling at the serving
wench who holds a mug of ale ready for the
first thirsty man...&

It is a relief to move
inside the %nt, away from the
burning summer heat, and you feel
that a cold mug of grog might
be in order...&

You enter the %nt, feeling
the cool shadows fall over your
face like a blanket...&

#0002b
You shake the rain from your
shoulders and enter the %nt,
hoping for a place where you can
at last rest and dry out...&

A burst of the warm summer
rain follows you into the %nt,
and you follow the many paths of
muddy footprints to the bar...&

Dripping from the summer
tempest outside, you enter the
%nt, relieved to have found shelter...&

#0002c
Although the sun isn't
shining, the humidity has
plastered your clothes to your back like a second skin. As you
close
the door to the %nt your eyes
search for a cool dark corner in
which to rest...&

It is uncomfortably hot and
sticky in the %nt, almost as bad
as the cloudy summer day
outside...&

You walk into the %nt from
the hot, cloudy day, welcomed
by the other patrons sequestered
away from the elements...&

#0002m
You are greeted by warm
laughter and merry talk as you
enter the %nt. Torches around the tavern shed light on this warm summer
night...&

The heat and humidity of the
day have disappeared, and it has turned out to be a pleasantly cool night.
The torches on the walls of
the %nt light up many a sunburned face...&

The summer night is almost as
warm as the day had been, and you enter the %nt craving something cold and
wet...&

#0002d
You enter the %nt, heartened
by the smells of food and
spices, and prepare to relax in the warm sunlight...&

The fiery autumn sun
disappears as you enter the %nt.
The sounds of laughter, clinking glasses, and banging
cooking
pans meet your ears...&

The townsmen have met in the
%nt to celebrate a good fall
harvest. Their exuberance is infectious. Oh great, you say to yourself,
I'll probably have this stupid drinking song in my head all day...&

#0002e
You enter the %nt and shake
the chill rain from your
shoulders, hoping for a fire of
some sort to dry yourself...&

Cold wind and rain follow
you into the %nt like a beggar.
You wipe your wet shoulders and
head as you head for the
fireplace...&

Shivering from the cold
autumn tempest, you escape
into the %nt. Other miserably wet people have gathered in
dripping groups...&

#0002f
The %nt tavern you enter is
brightly lit and colorful,
compared to the cold, dark clouds
that hang in the sky...&

You walk out of the cloudy
autumn day into the %nt, the
smell of baking bread pulling on
you like a lure...&

On an overcast autumn day
like today, the %nt is very
popular and you can see why. It certainly lifts the
spirits...&

#0002o
You enter the %nt, rubbing the chill night air from
your bones. The tavern is full of people bustling here and
there...&

On this cool autumn night,
the %nt seems especially
inviting. You smell apples baking
in the kitchen and look forward
to your first draught of ale...&

The warm smells of tobacco
smoke and simple foods draw you
into the %nt from the cold
autumn night...&

#0002g
You enter the %nt,
feeling the hearth fire slowly
chasing away the chill that has
crept into your bones from this winter's day...&

It is a pleasant day for
winter, and the red-cheeked townspeople in the %nt drink
their mulled wine to a toast for a long hibernation...&

The winter sunlight shining
through the %nt windows does as
much as the roaring fireplace
to warm your chilled body...&

#0002h
You close the door on the
snow and rub your hands together, warming them. Ahead of you the
innkeeper of the %nt hails you welcome, holding a steaming mug of
mulled wine...&

Great billows of wind and
snow follow you into the %nt
like a white shadow. The floor is
wet with the footprints of the patrons...&

Mulled wine is the featured
drink today in the %nt. You shake
the snow from your shoulders and
head, and think that nothing could sound better...&

#0002i
The bright colors of the
interior of the %nt add life to
the otherwise gray day...&

You enter the %nt and your
frozen senses revive to the
smell of fresh baked bread and the sound of the patrons
laughing with
the serving wench...&

The serving wench is passing
other patrons mugs of hot mulled
wine as you enter the %nt from
the cold, cloudy day...&

#0002p
You enter the %nt, out of the cold winter
night, making your way closer to
the fire...&

The %nt seems to be the last
bastion of warmth and light
against the arctic darkness outside...&

Rubbing your hands briskly
together, you enter the %nt. The fireplace is so grand in
the room, in short time you feel almost too warm...&

#0002j
A cool breeze follows you
into the %nt, bringing with it
the smell of newly bloomed flowers
and fresh cut grass...&

Through the open door and
windows, all the smells of
spring come into the %nt and the stuffiness of the winter
months fly out...&

You walk into the %nt,
immediately wishing you were again
out in the sunny spring day...&

#0002k
You enter the %nt and wipe
your rain soaked head on a small
towel offered by the serving
wench. Outside the spring shower continues...&

You are dripping wet as you
enter the %nt, but then again, so
are most of the rest of the
patrons. The barwench is busily passing out towels as well as drinks...&

You can still hear the
spring tempest outside, beating against the walls of the %nt. One of the %nt
maids stands by the
door, attempting to mop up a persistent leak...&

#0002l
The %nt's colorful interior
adds life to the otherwise gray
spring day...&

Despite the rather cloudy
conditions outside, the atmosphere inside the %nt is
extremely lively. Someone could even get hurt...&

You leave the overcast
spring day and enter the %nt.
The smell of simple baked breads coming from the kitchen
seems
like an invitation to stay.&

#0002q
You enter the %nt, searching
for a clear table at which you
can relax on this warm spring
night...&

The %nt is like a
beacon in the cool spring
night, full of torch light,
clinking glasses, and the
aromas of the kitchen...&

It is a cool spring night
outside, but you have no need
to seek out the fireplace on
entering the %nt. The tobacco
smoke and smell of new bread
trickles out the open windows and
into the night...&

#0003a
You enter the %tem, thankful
for the respite from the harsh
summer sun. You can hear
chanting in the distance...&

The stinging of prickly heat
is instantly soothed the moment
you enter the %tem sanctuary. In
the distance, you can hear the low murmur of chanting. This is a
place of great tranquillity.&

The god who protects this
%tem must be great indeed, for it
is as bright as the summer day yet comfortable as a shadowy place
within. A pleasant floral odor of incense fills the air.&

#0003b
You enter the %tem, shaking
the rain off of yourself. You can
hear chanting in the distance...&

You enter the hallowed
ground of the %tem sanctuary, the sounds of the summer rain
shower mixing with that of the chanting clergy. All your
tension like
water flows away.&

A fine mist, escaped from
the tempest outside, has
flooded the %tem sanctuary bringing all the smells of summer
with it. You recognize the sing-song
prayer of the clergy as a plea for
a bountiful fall harvest.&

#0003c
You enter the %tem, hoping
that your spirits can be lifted
on this gray, overcast day. You can hear chanting in the
distance...&

As miserable as the
sweltering summer day is, it is at least less eerie than the
sterile
%tem sanctuary. No birds or
insects can be heard in here, and
the air is empty of both smell and temperature. It may be very holy
indeed, but you feel like you have stepped into a void.&

The %tem sanctuary is a
haven for all, a place of self reflection, solitude, and prayer. It is
always perfectly mild in
here, as hot and cloudy as the day outside may be...&

#0003d
You enter the %tem and a
cool fall breeze follows you
into the hallowed halls. You can
hear chanting in the distance...&

The musty smell of autumn in
the outside air becomes mixed with
the spicy odor of incense as you
enter the %tem sanctuary...&

The stained glass windows in
the %tem sanctuary catch the
rays from the bright autumn sun
and transform them into crystalline fire.&

#0003e
You enter the warm %tem,
shaking the cold rain off of
yourself. You can hear chanting in
the distance...&

Wet from the autumn
thunderstorm, you enter the %tem, dripping. The warm smell of
incense begins to invigorate you, and in
the distance, you can hear the
%tem clergy at prayer.&

It is a place of peace, this
%tem sanctuary. Only by
concentrating on the world outside yourself can you hear the
vague drumbeat of the autumn
thunderstorm outside.&

#0003f
You enter the %tem, hoping
that your spirits can be lifted
on this cold, overcast day. You can hear chanting in the
distance...&

It is a miserable autumn
day, but within the %tem,
there is faith yet that the winter
may not be so deadly...&

Cold, dark clouds hang over
the %tem, but within you find
all is bright and warm. Billowing clouds of perfumed incense
greet the fog of your breath.&

#0003g
You enter the %tem, rubbing
your hands together to warm them
on this bright winter's day. You
can hear chanting in the
distance...&

The %tem sanctuary is as
austerely beautiful as the bright winter's day outside.
Tendrils of sweet incense rise from the floor
as if in greeting...&

On a day as cold as it is
blindingly bright, it is easy
to see why this part of the %tem is called the sanctuary. Far off to the
distance, you can hear
the clergy at prayer.&

#0003h
You enter the %tem, shaking
the snow off of yourself and
stamping your feet to warm them.
You can hear chanting in the distance...&

Brushing the snow off your
shoulders and head, you walk
into the %tem sanctuary. The smell
of incense strikes you
immediately, spicy and somewhat sweet...&

You trail some snow into the
%tem sanctuary as you enter. The
air is as cold as outside here,
yet filled with the smell of
incense and the sound of the
clergy praying...&

#0003i
You enter the %tem, rubbing
your hands to warm them and
hoping that your spirits can be
lifted on this cold, overcast day.
You can hear chanting in the distance...&

Already you can feel the
power of the %tem sanctuary,
thawing your frigid body,
brightening your spirits which
have grown dark as the cloud
filled sky...&

Strange sounds and smells
meet you as you leave the cold,
cloudy winter's day: the incense's bittersweet aroma is new to
your senses and the clergy of %tem
sing solemnly in a language dead
for many eons...&

#0003j
You enter the %tem and a
cool spring breeze follows you, bringing with it the smell of
fresh blooms. You can hear chanting in
the distance...&

It is bright and fresh in
the %tem sanctuary as the spring
day outside. In the distance, you
can hear the chanting of the
clergy.&

The smell of the new
blossoms of spring that came into
the %tem sanctuary with you mixes
with the slightly spicy smell of incense. You can hear the clergy far
away, giving a pray of thanksgiving for the beauty of the new year.&

#0003k
You enter the %tem, shaking
the warm rain off of yourself.
You can hear chanting in the distance...&

Trailing puddles of warm
spring rain behind you, you enter
the %tem sanctuary. An open
window lets the smell of the storm
in, overpowering the sweet
incense of the %tem itself.&

Wiping the warm rain from
your shoulders and head, you walk
into the %tem sanctuary. Off to
the distance, you can hear the
clergy, prayer in a sing-song
for a good planting season for the farmers...&

#0003l
You enter the %tem wishing
that the sun would return and make
the day a truly pleasant one.
You can hear chanting in the distance...&

You walk into the %tem,
smelling the sweet incense that
rises like a cloud from the
sanctuary floor. In the distance,
you hear the clergy praying
for a return of the sun to this
dreary spring day...&

You enter the %tem, gray as
this spring day sky. Almost immediately the bittersweet
smell of the incense strengthens your spirit. The clergy drone
their prayers far off in the distance.&

#0004a
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the summer heat. Many
items of interest hang on the walls and in the
display case in front of you...&

The interior of %en is neat
and well organized. You wipe
the sweat from your brow and look
over the weapons and gear...&

It is a relief to enter the
%en, out of the infernal
summer sunshine. Various supplies
are carefully arranged
throughout the store for your
browsing convenience...&

#0004b
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the summer rain. The cool
shade causes shivers to run over
your damp body. Many items of
interest hang on the walls and
are displayed in the display
case in front of you...&

The interior of %en is
spotlessly clean and neat. You
feel almost embarrassed to be
dripping puddles of warm rain
water all over as you glance
over the gear and weapon
displays...&

Wiping the warm water from
the summer shower off your head,
you enter %en. A display case
of the more popular supplies is featured in the small room.&

#0004c
You walk into %en. Many
items of interest hang on the
walls and in the
display case in front of you...&

%en is a refuge from the
steamy summer day. In the
display case and all along the
walls are supplies and weaponry
for sale...&

You enter %en from the
overcast summer day. You browse
over the items displayed throughout
the store and are impressed by the variety...&

#0004d
As you enter %en, golden
glints from the fall sun
reflect off of the many items of interest scattered
about...&

You enter %en from the sunny
autumn day. Cases of weaponry
are featured next to some of the
more peaceful supplies and gear...&

The pleasant autumn weather
has given %en an air of
joviality. You browse through cases and displays of various
supplies...&

#0004e
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the cold shower. As you dry
off you notice the many items of interest that hang on the
walls and in the display
case in front of you...&

You are handed a towel as
you come into %en from the
autumn thunderstorm. There is a
new shipment of weaponry and other gear, and you notice several pieces worth
looking at...&

You are dripping with cold
rain water as you enter %en. It
is a neat and clean chamber with a wide assortment of supplies and
weapons...&

#0004f
You enter %en rubbing your
hands together to warm them from
the chill. Many items of
interest hang on the walls and in the display case in front of
you...&

It is a miserable autumn day
outside, and it is good to get
inside %en. You glance over the
new shipments of supplies and weaponry.&

It is a bit early in the
year for this sort of chilling weather, but new supplies of
gear and armaments arrived at %en
with the cold. You find a few
useful items immediately...&

#0004g
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the cold and bright
winter's day. Many items of
interest hang on the walls and
are displayed in the display
case in front of you...&

%en is as bright as the
winter day outside and much
warmer. Several pieces of weaponry
and equipment look interesting
to you...&

You walk into %en, rubbing
your numb hands together. At least
it is sunny outside. Many new
weapons and supplies impress you enough for a closer
look...&

#0004h
You enter %en, stamping your
feet to warm them and shaking
the frozen snow from your
shoulders. Many items of interest
hang on the walls and are
displayed in the display case in
front of you...&

A warm fire in %en thaws
your frozen body and the snow
on your shoulders and head quickly melts. You notice several
supplies
in the display case and along the walls that just might be
useful...&

You let a spray of snow and
wind into %en as you enter.
Still, with the exception of the puddle by the door, the
chamber is neat and tidy. The walls and
display cases are fully stocked
with all varieties of weaponry and supplies...&

#0004i
You enter %en. Outside the
sun is hidden behind a thick
gray layer of clouds, dropping the temperature and making your
body
steam in the warmth of the shopkeeper's hearth. Many items of
interest hang on the walls and
are displayed in the display
case in front of you...&

You are quickly given a cup
of hot cider as you enter %en,
which you accept gratefully, happy
to be inside on such a gloomy
winter's day. You look over the weaponry and other
merchandise
proudly displayed in a case and all along the walls.&

The dog days of winter are
certainly here. You enter %en,
hoping for a deal or two on a
couple essential pieces of
equipment. Several things
immediately attract your attention
as you look over the display
case and the assortments along
the walls...&

#0004j
You enter %en and bring with
you a cool spring breeze that
ruffles many of the items of
interest hanging on the walls.
There are more items displayed in
the display case in front of
you...&

It is a beautiful spring day
outside, and the mood of the
blacksmith in %en is bright. Perhaps
you can get a good deal off
him on a couple of items that
impress you...&

An open window in %en brings
in the smell of spring flowers
as you look over your money to
see what you can afford. There are several displayed items
that
might prove useful...&

#0004k
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the cool spring shower.
Many items of interest hang on
the walls and in the display case in front of
you...&

It looks like a new shipment
of weaponry and other supplies
arrived in %en at the same time
the rain picked up outside. You
notice several items of interest
...&

You wipe the cool spring
rain from your shoulders and head
as you enter %en. Most of the
items within are meant more for the townsmen than you, but you do see some
adventuring equipment...&

#0004l
You enter %en, hoping that
the sun will show itself again.
There are many items of interest hanging on the walls and displayed in the
display case in front
of you...&

There is a window open in
%en: the blacksmith is apparently
hoping for some fresh scents of
spring to brighten a gray day.
Several weapons and supplies on display might be helpful to you
...&

It is a cold and overcast
day, and you doubt that the blacksmith
in %en is in the mood to barter.
You check your money supply as
you browse through the store's
wares...&

#0005
Would you deliver this %mi to
%tg in the %ct of %tc? A representative of %tg will be
there to receive it and reward you with %a gold for your
trouble.
%tc lies less than %du days journey %di
from here. You must get this vital information to %tg's man
in %tl before %da, or it will be worthless.
There are rumors that %o will
try to stop you. I would not put
too much faith in that, for my
enemies are many. Be alert at
all times for anyone. You would be doing my people a great
service.
Do you agree?&

I need you to deliver this
%mi to a representative of %tg
in %tc, a %ct not even %du
days journey to the %di. You must
get the %mi there before %da
for it to help %tg. My council believes %o will stand
between you
and %tg's man. I cannot be sure
this is true, but I would
advise vigilance nevertheless. If
you can make this delivery to
%tl in %tc on time, %tg will give you
%a gold pieces. Will you accept
this quest?&

If you agree to take this
%mi to %tg in %tc %di of %cn by %da, I can promise you %a gold
pieces from the representative there. You will find %tg's man in
%tl. I believe %o
will try to stop this shipment, but
my council believes otherwise. We
are agreed that you should be
ready for any encounter. It may be very dangerous indeed, but you
will
be %a gold richer if you reach %tl
by %da. Do we have a deal?&

#0006
My friend, I fear for the secession of
my eldest son, for ambition is great within this court. If anything were to happen to me, I shudder at the fate of %cn. I need you to make
a %du day journey to %tc to the %di and back. You will find a representative of %tg in
%tl - he
will have this %mi for you. I must have my %mi in my hands by %da, or the consequences may be all too
dire. %o will try to stop you, if my spies are correct. They have
not been reliable of late. If you can recover my %mi from %tg by then, I promise you %a gold
pieces. Can I count on you?&

Some months ago, for reasons
too mired in the muck of
politics to explain, I gave %tg in
%tc this %mi of mine.
It has become
extremely important to get this %mi back in %cn. I
understand you will
find a representative of %tg in
%tc, which is %du days
by horse to the %di and back. I do not know whether or not the rumors that %o
wants to keep the %mi in %tc are
true. There could be some
resistance along the way to %tl in %tc. I am prepared to offer you %a gold if that %mi is
here in the palace by %da. Can
I count on your help?&

In a philanthropic spirit
I now regret, I loaned %tg
of %tc this %mi that belonged, I
suppose, more to my %ct that to me.
I find I need to have that %mi back
here by
%da. %tg has a representative
waiting for you in %tc, which
is no more than %du days trip to the
%di, in a place called %tl. I
have a lot of enemies who
would like to see me suffer,
so you might encounter some
opposing forces.
You will have %a gold pieces if the %mi is back by %da. Agreed?&

#0007
I would be interested in
hiring your services to supplement
my militia. I fear that %o's forces are planning
an attack in an effort to depose me from my
rightful place. My spies have informed me that the attack
could happen anytime within the
next %du days. I would need you
to guard my daughter's suite during this
time, lending your aid to any attacks that may occur.
If you successfully protect the area, I will
reward you %a gold for your time.
Will you join me against this vile usurper?&

For some time, I have had
antagonistic relations with %o
and now my spies tell me an attack against my palace is
planned to take place within %du days. I need reinforcements if I am to
defend myself, but it will take my cousin at least %du days to send me
militia. I am forced to hire mercenaries. I will reward you with %a gold
pieces at the end of %du days if you join my guard and on your own are
able to defend the north-west wing of my palace.
Do we have a deal?&

If my spies are correct, my
rival to the throne, %o, is
planned a large scale invasion of
this very palace. They are quite certain that a
siege will occur in the next %du days, exactly how long it will
take for my allies to arrive to rebuff the attacks. I need men
desperately until then. If I can trust you to defend your post
in the ambassador's hall, I promist to pay you %a gold pieces.
Please, for the sake of %cn, help me.&

#0008
I would be most grateful if
you would agree to escort my %r, %ne, to %tc.
You can deliver %g2 to %tl there
where a representative
of mine will be there to
receive you. %tc lies
approximately %du days riding from here. You must however
deliver %ne before %da, otherwise you will
not be paid. Remember, I am
hiring you to deliver %g2 safely
and quickly, else I would escort
%g2 there myself. There are
rumors that %o will try to stop
you. Though I would not put too much
trust in that, be alert in any
case. For taking this amount of
time out of your busy schedule,
my representative will gladly pay
you %a gold upon your arrival.
Do you agree?&

My %r, %ne, has urgent business in
%tc, business that
demands %g be there by %da. If
you can make certain %g makes it to
my representative at %tl by
then, you will be paid %a gold
pieces. My council believes %o will try to stop my %r before %g
makes it to %tc, but this may
or may not be true. Can I entrust
this errand to you?&

I have a contact in
%tc, a little less than %du days to the
%di, in %tl waiting for the delivery of %ne,
my %r. I could not say if
it is true, though I have my suspicions, that %g, in
alliance
with %o, plans to usurp my
throne. Regardless of the
validity of these accusations, I
need %ne out of court
politics. It may be a hazardous journey if %g does, in fact,
have allies against me. Thus,
if you cannot get to %tl by
%da, my contact there is under
orders to leave to assume my %r
is free and to avoid any repercussions. Your generous
payment of %a gold will be forfeit.
Do you agree to these terms?
&

#0009
Come closer, I have no wish
to open this discussion to all
curious ears. I need someone with
your skills to capture someone for
me. He is %nc, a villianous %tt
and I wish to bring him to
justice. Others know of my desire
and may try to thwart you. It may
be %o. Be careful, it will take
you as much as %du days to journey to the %tan and back. I must have %nc by 
%da, or else he will be useless to
me. In return for you service I
will pay you %a gold when you
return, if you are successful. Do
you agree?&

Have you heard tale of %nc,
the infamous %tt? I
need him here, alive before my
court of justice by %da by any
means necessary, and I need you
to do it. I suspect %o is
likely to defend him. It is not
any easy task, but I am prepared
to pay you %a gold if, and only
if, you have %nc here on time.
Do you accept this quest?&

There is a criminal, a
villainous %tt by the name of
%nc, who is free in his home, the %tan, despite his many crimes against me
and my rule. I need him before me by %da or he may escape my justice. He has
a number of powerful allies, but my counselors tell me %o in particular will
try to defend him. On your successful and punctual return
with the accursed %tt in chains,
you will be paid %a gold. Can I
rely on you?&

#0010
A terrible fate has befallen
%nr, my %r. I think %g has been taken
by %o and secreted in a dungeon to the %di.
The crypt's name is the %tan. If you
would agree to save my %r, I would
reward you with %a gold. Be careful
however, I'm sure that %o
will try and stop you. You must have %nr
back before %da, or my
people will notice %g3 absence.
I cannot allow that. Hurry, and
good luck! Will you agree?&

%nr, my beloved %r, a gentle soul
unused to the cruelties of the
world, has disappeared. I know
that the forces of %o are responsible, and my poor
%r is probably in the %tan, a dungeon to
the %di. This affair could not
have happened at a worse time. You see,
%g is due to be married to an
important political ally on
%da. I must have my %r back by then
or there will be chaos. It will
not be easy for you to get back
in time, for even if %o knows not
of my intentions of rescue,
the %tan is notoriously well-defended. If I agree to pay you %a
gold for my %r's safe return,
may I count on your help?&

%nr, my %r, missing for days, has
finally been located in the
infernal pit of %tan to the %di.
I think %g is the prisoner of %o
there. I need you to use your
every talent to complete the rescue
by %da. After that I will send
someone else and your reward of
%a gold will be forfeit. I take it
you realize the strength of %o
and will not accept this quest
unless you feel you are capable.
Are you the person for the
quest?&

#0011
My lands are being stalked
by a deadly foe, one which has
evaded my hunters for weeks. It is
%mn, a %mt, and its lair is to the
%di of the %ct. I will pay you %a
gold if you would find and kill it, before it does anymore
harm to my people. The monster must be
dead before %da, for I hold
my daughter's wedding then and
would have people not fear to come
out of their homes. Do you agree?&

%mn, the %mt has fallen upon
my lands like a plague. In the
past, %mn has terrorized the
largest city-states and the
humblest villages in the
province, but I want its life to
end here, in its lair to the
%di. Kill it by %da, or it will feed on the people
celebrating my annual festival. Imagine the
political embarrassment. For a
reward of %a gold, are you strong enough to challenge %mn? &

My birthday is coming on
%da, and, as if in mockery, %mn
the %mt has come to my lands to
feed. It has slain all the hunters
I have sent after it, but word
has come that its lair is to the
%di of my %ct. You must go there
and kill it for me. If %mn is
alive to devour my people come
%da, the cost in human life and
loss of holiday revenue will be astronomical. I offer you %a
pieces of gold for the death of the %mt. Agreed?&

#0012 No deliver quest unknown

#0013
Greeting %pcn, and welcome to
%cn. We are a peaceful %ct, but
I would not recommend wandering
the streets unarmed at night. Now I fear I must dismiss you.
Political matters, you understand.
Goodbye.&

Hail to %pcn. I hope you
enjoy your stay in the %ct of %cn.
If you want to see some real
action, young %ra, try exploring the wilderness. You may
come back with something useful.
Now I must bid you farewell. Good day.&

Welcome to %cn, %pcn.
Please treat yourself to our
%ct's many pleasures. Our taverns
are a particular delight, the best mutton pie in the
province. Now I regret I must dismiss you.&

Tell me, young %ra, are you
in our fair %ct for business
or pleasure? No matter, %cn offers ample rewards for seekers of
either. You will find the people
here friendly and accomodating
- although I would not recommend leaving your weaponry back at
your inn if you wander at
night. Goodbye, %pcn.&

You call yourself %pcn,
is that right? Well, all I can
say is that we have had trouble
with another young %ra like
yourself a few days ago and it
would be a good idea to stay out of trouble. You are
dismissed.&

Let all in %hc know that we
in %cn welcome all travellers
wishing to do business in our %ct.
We are even giving in to
demands to build a new hall for
guild meetings. I hope you have a
very restful stay here, %pcn. You
may leave me now.&

#0014a
I welcome %pcn to my %ct.
Your arrival is fortuitous, for
I have a favor to ask. If you
would %qt for me, I would be
happy to reward you in gold.
Would you be interested in
hearing more?&

Good summertide to you, %pcn,
I bid you welcome to %cn. Your reputation precedes you, and I have need for
your talents. I am looking for an outsider to %qt for me. Of course, I
promise
ample payment if you are
successful. Are you interested
in hearing more?&

Yes, I've heard of you. You're
undoubtedly trying to make a few
gold pieces for yourself.
Ordinarily, I would dismiss you,
but right now the %ct could use someone of your type to %qt for us. Are you
interested?&

#0014b
I welcome %pcn to my %ct.
Your arrival is fortuitous, for
I have a favor to ask. If you
would %qt for me, I would be
happy to reward you in gold.
Would you be interested in
hearing more?&

Welcome, %pcn to %cn. It is
an opportune moment for you to
arrive, for I was just telling
my advisors last night I need
someone to %qt for me. You will,
of course, be generously
rewarded. Shall I tell you more
about it?&

Sorry to have kept you
waiting, %pcn. The duties of a
%t are exhausting.
I would be extremely grateful and
generous if you would relieve me of one
of them. Specifically I need
someone to %qt for me. Would you
like to hear the details about
it?&

#0014c
I welcome %pcn to my %ct.
Your arrival is fortuitous, for
I have a favor to ask. If you

happy to reward you in gold.
Would you be interested in
hearing more?&

On behalf of the citizenry
of %cn, I welcome you to our
%ct. I hope that you might agree
to help me. I need you to
%qt for me. May I tell you more
about the circumstances?&

Welcome to %cn, %pcn. A pity
the day is so overcast. I
assure you the beauties of %cn in
the bright summer sunshine are unsurpassed. On the other
hand, I
am glad you arrived, for I am
looking for someone of your talents
to %qt for me. I promise an appropriate award in gold.
Please allow me to give you the details.&

#0014d
I welcome you to my %ct.
Your arrival is fortuitous, for

Would you be interested in

Welcome to the
%ct of %cn. I would beseech you
to %qt for me. I cannot say that
it will be easy, but I can offer
you a great reward in return.
Perhaps I can tell you more?
&

I hope you are looking for
work because I need to
find someone who can do the job
right. I am a generous %t, and
you will be more than fairly
paid if you would %qt for me. Will
you help me?&

#0014e
I welcome you to my %ct.
Your arrival is fortuitous, for
I have a favor to ask. If you
would %qt for me, I would be
happy to reward you in gold.
Would you be interested in
hearing more?&

I would speak with you
immediately, %pcn, for I have a
favor, or if you prefer, a quest
to ask of you. If you would %qt
for me, I assure you that the
reward will be extremely rich.
Shall I tell you more?&

I'm very glad to see the
famous %pcn visiting our %ct, for
we have need for your talents. An emergency situation is
upon us, requiring someone who can %qt.
Can I count on you?&

#0014f
I welcome you to my %ct.
Your arrival is fortuitous, for
I have a favor to ask. If you
would %qt for me, I would be
happy to reward you in gold.
Would you be interested in
hearing more?&

I bid you welcome to the %ct
of %cn. If I could, I would
step from my throne myself, but
such is not where my duty lies.
My coffers are open to you,
should you accept my plea and
%qt for me. Tell me, do you wish
to know more?&

Welcome to the %ct of %cn.
You have been expected. Only a
few hours ago, the palace
Oracle made auguries and said only
you could %qt. Will you
hear more?&

#0014g
I welcome you to my %ct.
Your arrival is fortuitous, for
I have a favor to ask. If you
would %qt for me, I would be
happy to reward you in gold.
Would you be interested in
hearing more?&

Good day to you. I need
your assistance. Would you %qt
for me?&

I am grateful you picked
such a cold winter's day to
visit %cn, %pcn. As you can see, I
have many concerns right now, but
I need your help desperately to
%qt. May I tell you more about
the situation?&

#0014h
I welcome you to my %ct.
Your arrival is fortuitous, for
I have a favor to ask. If you
would %qt for me, I would be
happy to reward you in gold.
Would you be interested in
hearing more?&

My dear %pcn, what a
miserable day you've picked to
visit my %ct. In truth, though,
I'm very happy to see you, for
I've found myself in a dire
situation. I need someone to %qt
and I am willing to pay quite handsomely. Can you help? &

Ah, you're %pcn. I will
speak with you, for my %ct needs
help. We must %qt. I have heard you have sufficient
experience. Are you interested?&

#0014i
I welcome you to my %ct.
Your arrival is fortuitous, for
I have a favor to ask. If you
would %qt for me, I would be
happy to reward you in gold.
Would you be interested in
hearing more?&

Do not think you are a
stranger to me, %pcn. You could
not have picked a better time to
pay a social call on our %ct.
Not only is it my favorite time
of year, the dead of winter, but
I have a favor to ask of you.
Don't worry, I know better than
to ask anything immoral of you
just yet. If you would %qt for
me, my coffers are wide open to
you. You're brave enough to hear
more, are you not?&

Well, let us see if
you can live up to that name. I
have rather urgent need for
someone who can %qt. The %ct's
coffers are not exactly
overflowing, but I won't be frugal about the reward if you
accept.
Would you be interested?&

#0014j
I welcome you to my %ct.
Your arrival is fortuitous, for
I have a favor to ask. If you
would %qt for me, I would be
happy to reward you in gold.
Would you be interested in
hearing more?&

Greetings %pcn and welcome to
%cn. If you have come seeking
fame and fortune, I am looking
for someone to %qt. Can you
help us?&

I wish you had picked a
different time to visit %cn. I
am ashamed to say we have
become a %ct of fear and apprehension
under an invalid %t. Perhaps
you can help me. I need someone
of your ability and resource to
%qt. Do you wish to know more?
&

#0014k
I welcome you to my %ct.
Your arrival is fortuitous, for
I have a favor to ask. If you
would %qt for me, I would be
happy to reward you in gold.
Would you be interested in
hearing more?&

I would speak softly, for I
do not wish to endanger the good
cheer of my people, but I have
need of you. If you would %qt
for me, I would be extremely
grateful. Would you like to know
more?&

It appears I must find
someone to %qt for me. I
understand that your time is
valuable, so I am prepared to
offer quite a handsome sum for you services. Shall I tell you
more?&

#0014l
I welcome you to my %ct.
Your arrival is fortuitous, for
I have a favor to ask. If you
would %qt for me, I would be
happy to reward you in gold.
Would you be interested in
hearing more?&

I am looking for someone
who would %qt for a %t. Nothing
could be simpler. Give me your allegiance on this matter and I
will make you a rich person.
Perhaps you would like me to
describe the situation in more
depth?&

I bid you welcome to our
%ct, %pcn. I need a person who can
%qt. In return, you will be
rewarded beyond your most
avaricious dreams. Do we have a
deal?&

#0016
I received word from %tg of
%tc that there was no shipment of
that %mi. It was extremely
embarrassing for me. %tg thought I would chose someone capable of
such a delivery. It shows a bit
of nerve for you to come back to my court, unsuccessful in your
quest. You are not expecting
payment from me surely?
Now please go. Leave my sight.&

Your timing could not
be better. A messenger from %tg
just informed me that you never managed to get the %mi to %tc. I
wish
you had told me you were not
skilled enough to complete the
quest before you accepted it.
Begone, cretinous orc-vomit.&

I have to say I admire your
courage, %ra. Not many would
return to the palace where they received instructions they
could
not follow. Yes, I have already
heard that you were not able to
get my %mi to %tg. Ah well, it was probably too much for someone with your
limited experience. You may leave in dishonor, but in peace.&

#0017
I thought we had a deal. %a
gold for my %mi back from %tc by
%da. You appear incapable of fulfilling your part, and I
would
not insult you by explaining why
you will receive no reward. Good
day, young %ra.&

I did not get my %mi by %da,
so you will not see your %a
gold reward. You may leave in
peace. I had considered removing
all the veins from your body for inconveniencing me, but I changed my mind. I
am a fair %t, after all.&

Damn you, bastard child of a
%ra whore. You have no idea what trouble you have
caused by not getting my %mi on time. If I were
the same kind of %t as my predecessor, I would have
your lungs removed and eat them. Leave
me now, before I am tempted to do just that.&

#0018
Ah, you. I understand
that you brought the concepts
of cowardice and disloyalty to new depths during the recent skirmish
with %o. Surely you have come to
beg my forgiveness and are not so moronic to expect payment. I will
indeed forgive you. Now go. Your baseness stinks up the air
of %cn.&

You stun me. I have never
seen someone who deserted %g3
guard duty return without wearing chains. You are either
very brave or very stupid. Your action, or
lack of action, during %o's siege
on my palace prevents me from believing you to be brave.
That's good, because I am not in
the habit of having born idiots beheaded for
disloyalty. You may leave in peace.&

I want you to know that if a
member of my guard deserted me
during a siege and showed up later demanding payment like
you, I would have %g3 blood drained from %g3
body drop by drop. But I was
warned against using mercenaries. Because I have been as
foolish as
you have been cowardly, I allow
you to leave unharmed. But you
must do it now.&

#0019
Had I known that my %r was
capable of getting to %tl alone,
I would not have wasted my
time with you. As you have found,
%g is obviously more
capable than I thought. I assume
you have not come to ask for
payment but to apologize for your
sloppy job escorting,
Apology accepted. You may now leave.&

My %r is indeed in %tc. I
received word only a few
minutes ago. So you need not worry about %g2. I am sure you know I
cannot pay you for failure.
Begone, %pcn.&

%oth! What in the emperor's name
are you doing back in %cn? I sent
you to %tc with my %r and I understand %g never arrived, you
idiotic %ra. I must hire someone
else to find %g2. Leave my sight
before I do something violent.&

#0020
Where, you loathsome
excrement, is %nc, the man I sent
you for? Was it too difficult an assignment for you to get one
lone %tt? I told you I have no
patience for incompetence. Leave
me, you %ra dungpile, and do not
even think of asking for one
copper piece of your reward.&

Perhaps I did not make
myself clear when last you were
here, but I needed you to bring me %nc, the scourge of %tc, by
%da.
Your reward of %a gold was
based on that. Please leave me
now.&

I asked you to capture %nc
by %da, do you recall? Now it is
past %da, and you come to me emptyhanded. Well, you shall
return
empty handed, without a piece of
the %a gold reward. I had
considered lopping your fingers off
to make my point, so consider
yourself lucky. Off with you.&

#0021
Ah, good to see you again,
%pcn. Are you well? My %r is
grateful for the meager assistance
you gave %g2 in escaping the %tan.
You know %nr returned to my
palace only hours ago, of course.
Had you returned my %r yourself, I would have given your
reward. As
it is, that would be absurd. Farewell.&

Interesting rescuing
procedure. My %r
arrived a little while ago, worn
and bedraggled from a long
journey by foot. I cannot say
that you did nothing to rescue %g2, but obviously not enough to
merit your reward. Be off with
you.&

When I saw my %r walk out of
the wilderness and through the
city gates, I ran to ask where
you were, you who had rescued %nr. Imagine my surprise when %g
said %g had never seen you at
all, let alone been rescued by you. That constitutes mission
failure, young %ra, and that means no
reward. Goodbye.&

#0022
I did not require you to
bring me the head of %mn: I
would have ordinarily believed that the %mt was dead. But I
only
just heard that a farmer right
outside my %ct was murdered by
%mn. I must send someone else to
rid my lands of this menace.
Leave me now.&

I told you to slay the %mt
%mn by %da if you recall. I had expected more from an
experienced
%ra like you than my own hunters.
It would appears I was wrong.
Begone, you will get no reward
from me.&

Well, %mn did not attack my celebration as expected, but
only because it moved elsewhere in
the province. As for you, you
couldn't slay a goblin grub. Do
not expect any reward from me.
Off with you, young %ra.&

#0023
%t %fq's palace guards
prepare for combat like true professionals, sharpening their sabres and
polearms, sparring with
one another. Veterans show old
battle wounds to the neophytes who wish for glorious tales of
their own. Known battle tactics of %o
are discussed and analysed at
length before each soldier, including you, is sent to a different
location to prepare to repel enemy troops. You wait, blood
pounding in your head. Then, on day %de, your vigilance is
rewarded...&

You are tired of waiting.
The preparations to repel the
soldiers of %o have been thorough, professional, and tedious.
Strategy has been discussed exhaustively.
You know that the odds are
against %t %fq's troops, and
thirst for battle fills your every thought. Finally, %de
days after receiving your assignment, your
thirst can be quenched...&

You know that all you can do
is wait for the siege on the
palace of %fq, %t of %cn to begin. Impatiently, you scour
every inch of your assigned position and fill your mind
with thoughts of blood. The waiting
is almost getting to be too much
to bear when, on day %de, you hear
a cry...&

#0024
You rest from the battle,
but remain alert for fear of additional attacks on the %t's
palace. %de days into your
guard duty, your fears are realized...&

Wounds are tended to and the
dead are buried. %de days pass
since you first accepted this position. Suddenly, you hear the hideous
battlecry of %o's men
...&

There is little time to
recover from the last onslaught.
On day %de of your guard duty, the alarm rings out. You realize that
%o's men are attacking...&

#0025
I am supposed to be in %tc
with %tg tomorrow. Do you think
you'll be able to get me there on time?&

#0026
%ne says %g knows the way to
%tc from here and leaves you,
heading %di.&

#0027
You hear behind you a
distinct pop. You see %nc has
disappeared, apparently by some magical spell.&

A troop of guards bearing
the colors of %tq %fq take %nc prisoner
and bear him off to face the %tq.&

#0028
It is essential that I not
be late. Do you think you can
get me to %tq %fq by tomorrow?&

#0029
%nr thanks you for your
assistance and leaves you,
figuring %g has a better chance
making it to the %tq alone.&

#0030
Several men wearing the
colors of %tq %fq arrive. They
say the %tq is impatient for the
%mi and take it from you.&

You feel a strange,
uncomfortable sensation, as if something somehow has been
taken
from you.&

#0031
You must be %pcn. I am
from %tg, sent to pick up the %mi
from you. I'm glad you found
%tl on time. Here is your %a award.&

Ah, we were afraid you would
not be able to find %tl in
time. %tg will be so relieved to
get this %mi, and you will not
be forgotten, my good %ra.
Here's %a gold pieces, as
promised. Thank you and goodbye.&

My client, the council of
%tg is very anxious to get their
hands on that %mi, and they will be
so pleased that you delivered
it on time. Please accept these %a gold pieces as a humble token of our
esteem. Now I must be off. Goodbye.&

#0032
The odds were greatly
stacked against us, but I
believe %o will think again before attacking this palace again. The debt I
owe to you is tremendous. Please accept %ta gold pieces instead of the %a
I promised you
for your valor was inspirational indeed. Fare you well, %ra.&

In the annals of %cn, the
names of many new heroes today
will be writ. Against the
overwhelming might of the wicked
%o, you have prevailed and I am
indeed grateful. You are worth
more than the %a gold I promised. Accept instead %ta gold and go in
peace.&

I asked for a mercenary out
of desperation, and I got
instead a hero. You deserve more
than the %a gold originally
promised. Take instead %ta gold pieces. I would be very
surprised if %o ever again
menaces these lands. Go in
peace, %ra.&

#0033
Good day. I am glad to
see the %r of %tq %fq had
such a professional escort to
%tc. Please accept our gratitude
and these %a gold pieces.&

What a delight to see you
and %ne at %tl on
time. Good job, %ra. Here is
your promised %a gold.&

Welcome to %tl. I see you
have %tq %fq's %r %ne with you. It is
my pleasure to offer you %a gold, as promised.&

#0034
Ah, %nc, you do not look so
happy to see an old friend. I
hope %pcn treated you kindly. My palace court is meeting now, and there
you will doubtless be
given the same gentleness. Treasurer, give %pcn the %a gold I promised.
You have my gratitude, young %ra.&

Welcome back to %cn, %pcn. Let me see what guest you
have brought. Why it is %nc, my
old friend. I believe you
have an appointment with my court
of law, %tt. As for %pcn, you should be proud to have
brought this wicked man to justice. Here are
the %a gold pieces I promised.
Go in peace.&

O most wicked %tt, at last you
must pay for your crimes. I will
be more merciful to you than you
were to the people of my %ct.
Away with him. As for you, %pcn,
here is the reward of %a gold
pieces I promised. Know that
the %t of %cn is grateful to
you.&

#0035
%nr, my beloved %r, free at last
from %o. Good %pcf, you have made my heart glad indeed. Here are %a gold
pieces, as I promised. May
Marduk the Good smile upon you and grant you happiness.&

You have rescued my %r
from %o, and my gratitude to you is enormous. Please accept the %a gold
pieces as a token of the debt I owe. Good luck in your travels. You will be
remembered in %cn.&

My heart is full of gratitude
to you. I feared I
would never see my %r again. In addition to your reward of %a gold, I have
ordered my scribes to write you into the tomes of %cn, so you will never be
forgotten. Bless you, good %ra.&

#0036
Is %mn the %mt dead at last?
No other %ct in the province was
able to destroy this monster, but thanks to you, %cn will be called the %ct
that slew %mn. You have
certainly earned you %a gold, good %ra. Take it and go in peace.&

Even before you arrived, I
heard from the peasants outside the %ct that %mn the great %mt was dead,
slain by a valiant %ra. You have
earned your %a gold and a place
in the history of %cn, if not the whole province. The %t and
people
of %cn thank you.&

You do not even have to tell
me that the fearsome %mt is dead.
Word has spread quickly. Already
there are ballads being written about
how the brave %ra slew %mn, scourge
of %cn. Of course, fame alone
cannot keep you fed, so here is the
%a gold pieces I promised you.
Good luck and come back to our %ct anytime.&

#0037
I am glad to see you found my
%mi. You have my thanks for your timely return and the %a gold pieces I
promised you. You will not be soon forgotten in this court.&

Ah, you return with my
%mi. I have to admit I feared you would not return in time. You have earned
your %a gold, good %ra. Thank you.&

The people of %cn may never
know what you have done for them by retrieving my %mi, but I shall never
forget. Take your %a gold pieces, and know that you have the gratitude of %t
%rf of %cn.&

#0038
Wait, %pcf! Now that I hear all you have
done, I insist that you take %ta
gold instead of the %a gold I promised.&

Hold, %pcf! Take %ba more gold
pieces. You have earned it by your toil.&

The council has ordered that
the extraordinary difficult of your assignment merits you an
extra %ba gold, making your award %ta gold pieces instead.&

#0039
You have promised %tq %fq of %qc to
deliver %g3 %mi to a representative of
%tg of %tc in %tl by %da. You
have %ti days to complete this quest.&

#0040
You have been hired by %fq,
%tq of %qc to recover %g3 %mi from %tg
of %tc. A representative will be waiting for you in %tl. You must have %mi in
the %tq's hands by %da.&

#0041
You have agreed to protect your post in the
palace of %fq, %t of %qc for %du days. Today is day %de of your militia duty.&

#0042
You are escorting %ne, %tq
%fq's %r, to %tl in %tc, %di of %qc. You must bring %g2 to %tl by
%da.&

#0043
You have been hired by %tq %fq
to bring %nc, a %tt of %tc back to
%qc by %da. %nc is in the %tan.&

#0044
%tq %fq has hired you to
rescue %nr, the %tq's %r who is imprisoned in the %tan,
%di of %qc. You must have %g2 back in
%qc by %da to earn the %a gold reward.&

#0045
You are on a quest to slay the
dread %mt %mn for %fq, %tq of %qc. %mn's lair is said to be %di of %qc, and
you must have killed the beast by %da.&

#0046
You're here for the %mi, am I right? Here it is.
Tell %tq %fq I said thank you.&

%tq %fq sent you for the %mi? Damn, I could've used it. Well, hurry back to
%g2.&

Here's the %mi that %tq %fq needs. You better be on your way back to %g2 now.&


#0047
Today the people of %cn are having the New Life Festival
in celebration of a new year. The Emperor has ordered yet another 
tax increase in his New Life Address, and there is much grumbling
about this. Still, despite financial difficulties, the New Life
tradition of free ale at all the taverns in the %ct continues.
The people of %cn certainly know how to hold a celebration ...&

#0048
The 15th of Morning Star is a holiday taken very
seriously in %cn, where they call it South Wind's Prayer,
a plea by all the religions of Tamriel for a
good planting season. Citizens with every affliction known
in Tamriel flock to services in the %ct's
%tem temple, as the clergy is known to perform free healings 
on this day. The people know that only a few will be judged
worthy of this service, but few can afford the %tem's usual
price...&

#0049
Today is the 16th of Sun's Dawn, a holiday celebrated all over
Tamriel as Heart's Day. It seems that in every house, the Legend
of the Lovers is being sung for the younger generation. In honor
of these Lovers, Polydor and Eloisa, the inns of the %ct offer a
free room for visitors. If such kindness had been given the Lovers,
it is said, it would always be springtime in the world.&

#0050
On the 7th of First Seed every year, the people of %cn celebrate First
Planting, symbolically sowing the seeds for the autumn harvest. It is
a festival of fresh beginnings, both for the crops and for the men
and women of the %ct. Neighbors are reconciled in their disputes,
resolutions are formed, bad habits dropped, the diseased cured. The
clerics at the %tem run a free clinic all day long to cure people of
poisoning, different diseases, paralyzation, and the other banes found
in the world of Arena.&

#0051
Be warned that today is Jester's Day in the %ct of %cn,
and pranks are being set up from one end of town to the other.
It is as if a spell has been cast over the community, for even the
most taciturn and dignified councilman might attempt to play a
joke on his %t. The Thieves Guild finds particular attention
as everyone looks for pickpockets in particular.&

#0052
The celebration of Second Planting is in full glory this
day. It is a holiday with traditions similar to First Planting,
improvements on the first seeding symbolically to suggest 
improvements on the soul. The free clinic of
the %tem is open for the second and last time this year, offering cures
for those suffering from any kind of disease or affliction.
Because peace and not conflict is stressed at this time, battle
injuries are healed only at full price.&

#0053
Today is the 16th of Mid Year, the traditional day for the Mid Year
Celebration. Perhaps to alleviate the annual news of the Emperor's
latest tax increase, the %ct temples offer blessings for only half the
donation they usually suggest. Many so blessed feel confident enough to
enter the %lp dungeons when they are not fully prepared, so this
joyous festival has often been known to turn suddenly into a day of defeat
and tragedy.&

#0054
The bargain shoppers of the known world are out in force today and it is
little wonder, for the 10th of Sun's Height is a holiday called the
Merchants' Festival. Every marketplace and equipment store has dropped
their prices to at least half. The only shop not being patronized today
is the Mages Guild, where prices are as exorbitant as usual. Most
citizens in need of a magical item are waiting two months for the
celebration of Tales and Tallows when prices will be more reasonable...&

#0055
You will have to wait until tomorrow if you are planning on
making any equipment purchases, for all stores are closed in
observance of Sun's Rest. Of course, the temples, taverns, and
Mages Guild in the %ct are still open their regular hours,
but most citizens chose to devote this day to relaxation, not
commerce or prayer. This is not a convenient arrangement for
all, but the Merchants' Guild heavily fines any shop that stays
open, so everyone complies.&

#0056
Perhaps no other festival fires the spirit of the %ct of
%cn as much as the one held today, Harvest's End. The work of the
year is over, the seeding, sowing, and reaping. Now is the time
to celebrate and enjoy the fruits of the harvest, and even visitors
to the %ct are invited to join the farmers. The taverns offer
free drinks all day long, an extravagance before the
economy of the coming winter months. Underfed farm hands gorging
themselves and then getting sick in the town square are the most
common sights of the celebration of Harvest's End.&

#0057
No other holiday divides the people of %cn like the 3rd of
Hearth Fire. A few of the oldest, more superstitious men
and women do not speak all day long for fear that the
evil spirits of the dead will enter their bodies. Most
citizens enjoy the holiday, calling it Tales and Tallows,
but even the most lighthearted avoid the dark streets of %cn,
for everyone knows the dead do walk tonight. Only the Mages
Guild completely thrives on this day. In celebration of the
oldest magical science, necromancy, all magical items are
half price today.&

#0058
Today is the 13th of Frostfall, known throughout Tamriel
as the Witches' Festival when the forces of sorcery and
religion clash. The Mages Guild gets most of the business since
weapons and items are evaluated for their mystic potential
free of charge and magic spells are one half their usual
price. Demonologists, conjurors, lamias, warlocks, and
thaumaturgists meet in the wilderness outside %cn, and the
creatures created or summoned there may plague Tamriel
for eons. Most wise men choose not to wander this night.&

#0059
Once the 30th of Frostfall, the Emperor's Birthday, was
the most popular holiday of the year. Great traveling
carnivals entertained the masses, while the aristocracy of %cn
enjoyed the annual Goblin Chase on horseback. Recently,
these traditions have fallen into neglect. It has been decades
since there was a big carnival in %cn and longer still since a
%t of the %ct sponsered a Goblin Chase. It is rumored that the
Emperor has even begun refusing any audience.&

#0060
Today is the 20th of Sun's Dusk, the Warriors Festival in
%cn. Most all the local warriors, spellswords, and rogues come to the
%ct's equipment stores and blacksmiths where all weapons
are half price. Unfortunately, the low prices also tempt many an
untrained boy to buy his first sword and the normally quiet %cn
streets ring with amateur skirmishes. The %t has pardoned most of
these ruffians in the past, but has promised to be less merciful
this year.&

#0061
Today is the 15th of Evening Star, a holiday reverently observed
by the %tem as North Wind's Prayer. It is a thanksgiving to the Gods
for a good harvest and a mild winter. Some years, like this one,
the harvest was not particularly good and the winter unseasonally
harsh in %cn, but as the %t is fond of saying, "It could be much
worse." The temples offer all their services blessing, curing,
healing for half the donation usually requested.&

#0062
On the last day of the year the Empire celebrates the
holiday called Old Life. Many go to the temples to reflect
on their past. Some go for more than this, for it is rumored
that priests will as the last act of the year perform
resurrections on beloved friends and family members free
of the usual charge. Worshippers know better than to expect this
philanthropy, but they arrive in a macabre procession with
the recently deceased nevertheless.&

#0063
You see a loathsome vermin
looking at you with stupid
cunning...&

You see something has crawled
out of the sewers, mindless with starvation and diseases
...&

You see an enormous rodent,
stinking of garbage and plague
...&

#0064
You see a small, hideously
deformed man...&

You see something that looks
like an insane, terribly
disfigured child...&

You see a cruelly twisted and
shrunken little man...&

#0065
You see a reptilian humanoid,
its eyes revealing its cold-blooded nature...&

You see a man-beast, scales
glistening in the light...&

You see a hybrid of a man and
a dragon, reptilian in its claws, fangs, and eyes...&

#0066
You see a large wild dog, its
powerful jaws slavering...&

You see something has come out
of the timbers, a low growl
rumbling in its snapping jaws...&

You see a dark, matted beast,
strands of bloody saliva dripping from its snapping canines
...&

#0067
You see an enormous snow-white
dog, cool wind coming from its jaws
in a mist...&

You see something has come out
of the timbers, a low growl deep
in its throat, its teeth snapping...&

You see a beast that looks
like a cold marble statue,
its canine teeth and eyes very much alive...&

#0068
You see a tall, pig-faced man
...&

#0069
You see a pile of bones that
somehow can move...&

#0070
You see a giant, misshapened
man with the head of a bull ...&

#0071
You see a huge arachnid, venom dripping from its fangs, eyes
focusing on you...&

#0072
You see a grotesque caricature
of a man, stinking of carrion and
lice...&

#0073
You see an wolf-like animal
with eyes that glow as red as new embers...&

#0074
You see something that looks
like a transparent
man...&

#0075
You see a man, eyes devoid of
thought, flesh pale and covered
with the rot of the grave...&

#0076
You see a giant man,
gruesomely proportioned and
apparently hungry...&

#0077
You see a skeletal apparition,
eyes burning red...&

#0078
You see a small, winged demonling, hissing and spitting at
you...&

#0079
You see a strange, almost
crystalline man, the air around
him cold and dry...&

#0080
You see a man covered in a web
of cracks, a fine shroud of dust disguising his features
...&

#0081
You see a slate-colored man,
the air around him crackling...&

#0082
You seem something that looks
like the Devil itself...&

#0083
You see a hybrid between woman
and snake so horrible the blood
in your veins begins to chill...&

#0084
You see a very pale man with
bright red eyes...&

#0085
You see a robed figure with a
white, skull-like face...&

#0086
Before you reach the bar, a %ds signals to you and speaks in a conspiratorial whisper:&

A %ds nervously draws you aside as you approach the bar.&

You are about to go to the bar when a %ds calls you to a table.&

#0087
I need your help. If this %omq isn't at %tl by %da, my life ain't going to be
worth a copper. Someone'll be there to take the %omq if you're there on time,
and I'm sure they'll give you %a gold for it. Can you help me? I'm desperate.&

They tell me you're called %pcn. If you're as tough as you look, I know a
way for you to get a quick %a gold pieces. This %omq I have was supposed to be
at %tl yesterday and if it ain't there by %da, things
could get real nasty. Someone there will give you your reward if you're at
%tl
on time. Do we got a deal?&

Lend me your ear for a moment, %ra. For reasons of utmost importance to the
welfare of this %ct, it is imperative
that this %omq be delivered to %tl by %da. I
have a contact there who will give you %a gold if you can make it on time. Will
you help me and %cn?&

#0088
You have a kindly face, %ra, and I need a friend. You see, I loaned a %omq of
sentimental value to someone in %tl and now I find I must have it back. Would
you get it for me? I'd be happy to give you %a gold for its safe return, but I
must have the %omq by %da. Do we have a deal?&

I need help, young %ra. I am supposed to get a %omq
back from an agent of mine in %tl. If I don't have it by %da, I will lose a
good deal of money. Unfortunately, I cannot get the %omq myself. I will give
you %a gold if you get me the %omq on time. Do you agree?&

Good %ra, if you could use %a gold pieces, hear me
out. There is a certain person in %tl who has something of my liege's, a %omq.
I loaned this %omq a few weeks ago, and now I've discovered my liege is
returning to %cn early, on %da. Would you get this %omq for me? You would have
my gratitude and %a gold. &

#0089
I must keep my voice down, young %ra. A few minutes before you walked in, there
was a crowd of ruffians in here, members of %o, no doubt. Well, they were
getting a
little drunk and rambunctious and I asked them politely to leave. I got this
look from them that's been making me very nervous. Do you think you could watch
the street outside my business
after hours tonight and make certain no damage is done? I'd be happy to pay %a
gold for your protection. &

Have you heard of %o, good %ra? If you have, you know
why I'm whispering. I owe them money, a lot of money. Their master has openly
threatened to tear this inn of mine down around my ears this very night. Would you
watch outside this inn tonight and protect it? I can offer you %a gold for your services. Please,
will you help me?&

I called you over because you're the toughest looking %ra in this place and I need
your help. %o contacted me last night and asked if I was interested in
selling my business. I said no, which obviously wasn't the
right answer. I'm sure they're going to send some of
their people over tonight to ruin me. I'll give you %a gold pieces if you'll
stand guard outside the inn for me tonight. Agreed?&

#0090
Sorry for disturbing you, but I was hoping you might
be on your way to %tl. You see, I have a %r who needs to
be escorted there, and I have a friend there willing to pay up to %a gold if you
can get %g2 to %tl by %da. I'd do
it myself, but I have an injury to my sword arm and I wouldn't be able to defend
us if there was any trouble. Will
you agree to escort my %r, %ne?&

Good day. I'm having a little problem I hoped
you be able to solve. For reasons of business, %ne, that's my %r, needs to get
to %tl by %da. I had a couple swordsmen hired to escort %g2 there, but they
wound up dead a half hour ago, chopped into goblin snacks by the Afterdark
Society. I was going to have
my contact in %tl pay them %a gold. That money's yours if you take their place.&

You are precisely the sort of %ra I've been looking
for to escort my %r %ne to %tl. I know it's probably out of your way, but if you
can get %g2 there by %da, you'll at least be %a gold
richer. %ne will see to it that my contact at %tl will pay. Will you agree to
help me?&

#0091
I understand. Thanks anyway. And, by the way, if you
tell anyone what I just told you, I'll pull all your teeth out by way of your
neck. Have a nice day.&

Won't even consider it, eh? To be expected, I suppose. I've always heard that
your typical %ra is a
lazy, stupid, stinking pile of kobold dung. No hard feelings.&

Really? You won't help me? Then do me one favor:
don't let anyone know what I talked to you about. Goodbye.&

#0092
Ah, I had heard %fq had sent you on this errand.
Glad to see you made it on time with the %omq. Here are your %a gold pieces.
Thank you.&

What a marvelous %omq, and it's even here on time. Quite unlike %fq to be so
punctual, I assure you. Well, enjoy your %a gold piece reward. You've
earned it.&

I've been expecting you and the %omq, but I can tell you now I hadn't expected
you to arrive on time. Good speed. I believe %a gold pieces was the amount agreed on.&

#0093
You're here for the %omq, am I right? Here it is.
Tell %fq I said thank you.&

%fq sent you for the %omq? Damn, I could've used it. Well, hurry back to
%g2.&

Here's the %omq that %fq needs. You better be on your way back to %g2 now.&


#0094
The %ra returns with my %omq! You don't know how
nervous I was, fearful you wouldn't be able to find %tl or get back here in
time. You have certainly deserved your %a gold. I owe you more than you will
ever know. Thank you,
good %ra.&

Excellent job. I knew you were the right %ra for the errand the moment I
saw you in here. I wish I could
give you more than these %a gold pieces. Good luck, young adventurer, and
know that someone in %cn is forever grateful to you.&

I heard you had picked up the %omq from %tl, but I
admit I feared you wouldn't get it back here on time.
As promised, here are your %a gold pieces. I am very grateful. Thank you,
noble %ra.&

#0095
You ready yourself in preparation for %o's
hordes, becoming so accustomed to the dark that you know every shadow, every
noise around you intimately. It is the faintest noise, the scratch of steel
against stone that alerts you. You are not taken by surprise by the attack
minutes later...&

Many hours have gone by since you agreed to %fq's request. Every shadow,
every noise here has become so
familiar to you that almost all the tension has melted away. Your eyes have
just started to drop when you notice a slight movement just ahead of you. You
ready yourself for battle...&

You agreed to protect this place for %fq, but as the
night grows deeper and darker, you begin to have second
thoughts. Everyone knows what a powerful organization %o is, to
openly confront them may be considered suicide. You hear a
cough that no one else would have heard. You prepare for a
battle and seconds later, you have one...&

#0096
I cannot thank you enough for protecting my place. If
I could afford it, I would certainly pay you more than
the %a gold I promised, but here it is. I'm going to try and make amends with %o
today. I imagine after the beating they took tonight, %o will be more open to my
point of view. Thank you, friend.&

Here is the %a gold I promised. I have to admit I'm stunned to look around and
see what all %o sent against me. They're more powerful than I thought if they
can afford to waste such mighty warriors on a minor annoyance like me. Oh well,
that's none of your concern. You fought bravely tonight, and for that I thank
you.&

Never have I seen anyone fight members of %o with
such courage. You were outnumbered, but I never saw you pause and consider
retreat. Here are the %a gold pieces I promised, worthy %ra. I'll meet with %o
today and allow them to apologize. Farewell.&

#0097
Good to see you, %ne. I can see %pcn protected you
well against the annoyances of %cn and has deserved the %a gold pieces.
Goodbye, mighty %ra.&

Remarkable job, I don't know if I could've
survived so long with %ne. But then, %fq's %r has always annoyed me greatly.
Here is your %a gold. I bid you well.&

Good day to you, %ne, and to you, %ra. I am pleased
you have taken such good care of %fq's %r. Your %a gold is well deserved. Enjoy
it and fare you well.&

#0098
%ne asks you whether you are almost to %tl, commenting that %g
must be there tomorrow. Do you think you'll be able to make it
there on time?&

%fq's %r %ne seems a little doubtful that you'll make
it to %tl by tomorrow. You know %g is willing to go on alone.&

#0099
%ne leaves the group and heads out, assuming %g can
make it to %tl alone.&

#0100
Greetings, I am %n, a %oc. I %doc.&

They call me %n the %oc. I %doc.&

I am called %n, the %ct %oc. You know, I %doc.&

You can call me %n. I am a %oc, you know, I %doc.&

You can call me %n. I am a %oc. I %doc.&

We haven't met, have we? I'm %n, the %oc. I %doc.&

Good day, %ra. My name is %n the %ct %oc. I %doc.&

I am named %n. I'm a %oc and I %doc.&

Greetings, %ra. I'm %n, a typical %oc, and I %doc.&

My name is %n, the %oc. I %doc.&

#0101
The boys call me %n. I'm a whore.&

Ain't much need for names, is there? Well, you can call me %n, if you wanna.&

I am %n. My business is in making boys happy. Ain't that nice?&

I meet more %ra boys than girls, but business is business. I'm %n.&

Very nice to meetcha. I go by %n. It's my... career name.&

#0102
The name's %n, if you really want to know it. Most guys don't care.&

Looking for some company, %ra? You can call me %n or anything you want.&

I'm %n. No offense, honey, but I don't like %ra boys much. You might want to talk
to one of the other ladies down the street.&

I don't believe we've ever met, I'm %n. I heard there was a cute new %ra in town.
all the girls will be jealous when they see us talking.&

I've seen %ra eyes before, but never any quite like yours.
Tell me what I can do... for you, honey.&

#0103
Me? I'm %n, but I have to tell you something. %jok Bet you haven't heard that one
yet.&

Hello, I'm %n, but then again, ultimately, aren't we all? What can I do for you?&

Yello, I'm Horny. Whoops, I mean, I'm Randy. No seriously, I'm %n. You can see how I
got it confused. What can I do for you, my sweet %ra? By the way, %jok&

Good day, I'm %n, and if you think you've got problems, listen to this. %jok Now,
what's thy story?&

You don't remember me? %n? Well, you were pretty drunk at the time. Anyhow, you'll
be happy to know the baby isn't yours. Stop me if you've heard this. %jok&

#0104
I am %n, and, you won't believe this, I'm a firebreather. %oth, I know that must come as a
surprise to you... so what do you want?&

They call me the Human Torch. I think there are a few other imitators with my name,
so you can call me %n. What can I do for you, stranger?&

I am called %n, a firebreather. How can I help you?&

No, I am not busy doing anything. Just standing around, like any other day,
breathing fire. I am %n, at your service.&

I am %n, and, as you might have noticed, I breathe fire.&

#0105
Yes? I am %n, and this is my cobra %sn. How may we help you?&

Have you come to pet my snake? No? Well, tell me what %n can do for you.&

Ah, %sn, we have a visitor. Good day, young %ra, I am called %n.&

You are a brave man to come so close to my cobra. What would you ask of %n?&

I do not believe we've met, %ra. I am %n, and this is %sn, my snake.&

#0106
Alms? Alms? No, you want something from %n, don't you?&

Ah, %n thinks it's a good %ra to come talk to him. What can %n do for him?&

Me am poor %n. Do not hurt poor %n, and me answer question.&

You ain't gonna give me no money, but I've gotta talk to you? If that's fair, my
name ain't %n. Well, what do you want anyhow, %ra?&

What do you want from me, %ra? %n is a busy man.&

#0107
'Tis a slow day for business, %ra. I am %n, at your disposal.&

Good day, I am %n. I do not think I have anything that would interest you.&

What ho, young %ra. How can a poor peddler like %n help you?&

Pleased to make your acquaintance, %ra. I am the peddler %n. How may I help you?&

Remember what I, %n the Peddler, always say: everything is for sale. Though perhaps,
you are looking for information?&

#0108
Good to see some young blood in our %ct, %ra. Anything %n, esquire, can help you
with? Information, perhaps?&

Good child, %n is my name, and if you want to know anything about %cn, ask me.
I've been here forever.&

You're new to %cn, young %ra? You could not have picked a better %ct. I, of course,
am %n, Merchant Extraordinaire.&

You may call me %n. Ignore the baubles on this table. You should visit %en. My
finest wares are there.&

You're never going to believe this, but I sell stuff. I know this big table of
things for sale probably confused you, but, yes, that's me: %n, the seller of
stuff.&

#0109
Nosy, ain't you? I'd watch out. %cn ain't as innocent a %ct as it looks.&

Most people in %cn calls me %n. You could say I'm a businessman.&

Today my name's %n. Tomorrow maybe it won't be. You're looking for information,
%ra?&

Well, I ain't a %cn tourist guide. I guess you can call me %n. That's me business
name.&

What is it your business who I am? You better watch yourself, kid. Not everyone in
%cn is as friendly as me. So what do ya want?&

#0110
A wizard, of course. Don't they have those in %hc? Yes, I know who you are, %ra.
Men call me %n. What can I do for you?&

I am %n, the finest wizard in %cn. What can I do for you, young puppy?&

We Thaumurgists believe that to possess a man's name is to possess his soul. If you
must call me something, call me %fn.&

The Mages' Guild has given me the name %n, to show I am one of their own. What may
I do for you, stranger?&

My name, you mean? Let me see...%fn...%n, I believe, yes. I am one of the
sorcerers to the court of the %t. You have a question about my %ct?&

#0111
I am %n of the %tem, my child. How may a poor monk help you?&

The %tem has given me the name %fn. I am a little familiar with the %ct outside my
temple. I'll tell you anything I know.&

I have taken the name %fn, for that was the name of the savior of my village. What
can I do to point you in the path of salvation, sinful %ra?&

You do not know? I am only %n, one of the personal priests of %t %rf. You must be new
to town.&

Nice to meet you, %ra. I am %n of the %tem. Can I give you some of our literature, or
do you need something else?&

#0112
Decent tune, eh, %ra? I call that tune '%cn, Jewel of %lp.' %n's my name.&

Do you often interrupt musicians in the middle of a rehearsal? Little respect for
art these days especially here in %cn. Ah well, I'm %n. What can I do for you,
stranger?&

I'm a musician, obviously, playing music. At least I was until you interrupted me.
The name's %n. Well, what do you want? I'm a busy man.&

I'll give you three guesses. Give up? I'm a lutist, name of %n. Perhaps you've heard
of me.&

Just a traveling musician, %n they call me. What can I do for
you, %ra?&

#0113
Well, I sure ain't the %t of %cn. I'm just %n, humble street cleaner. How can I
help you?&

My name is %n, the street-cleaner. What a mess, eh? Somebody has to clean up after all of you
strangers.&

Me? Listen, I ain't looking for trouble. I'm only poor %n, a lowly employee of the
%ct, doing my job, sweeping the streets. Do you need something?&

You lost or something, kid? I'm %n. Usually nobody talks to me. They think I'm
crazy.&

I'm a street-cleaner. Big surprise, eh, %ra? I go by the name of %n. You new to
town or something?&

#0114
Hello there, %ra, I am %n, the finest personnel agent in %lp. Are you interested in
something male, female, non-human, what? You're looking for something else?&

Who do you think I am, %ra? None other than %n, procurer of the most loyal, um,
workers money can buy. You don't look much like a buyer, kid.&

I'm %n, and I'm a flesh peddler. It's not very noble, but somebody's gotta do it.
So, what do you want?&

Good day, %ra, I'm %n, Slaver Extraordinaire. Please don't talk to the merchandise.
Can I interest you in some goblins? Two for the price of one.&

The slaves can't talk, %ra. If you wanna do business, do it through me. I'm their,
ah, agent, %n. Pleased to meetcha.&

#0115
I'm %n. Remember? The %oc?&

%oth, how soon they forget. I'm %n, the friendly %oc.&

I'm %n the %oc, remember?&

I remember you, %ra. I'm the %oc %n&

Can't remember, young %ra? I'm a %oc by name of %n.&

%oth, talk about a short memory. %n the %oc, at your service.&

%oth, you forgot already? I'm %n, a %oc with a good memory.&

I'm the %ra and you're %n the %oc, or the other way around.&

We've already met, %ra. I'm %n the %oc, remember?&

Good to see you again, %ra. %n the %oc, remember me?&

#0116
Yeah, I remember you, %ra. I'm %fn, the courtesan, remember?&

I don't mind you forgetting me. Nature of business. I'm %fn the whore.&

%oth, think really hard, %ra. Oh well, I'm %n, the, ah, lady of the night.&

We met before, %ra. I'm a tart, by the name of %fn.&

I'm %n the harlot. Remember, we spoke before?&

#0117
You know me, honey. Well, we only talked before I guess. %n, mistress to the %ra
kings.&

Not too many %ra boys forget %fn. Of course, we usually did more than just talk.&

%oth, honey, you're hurting %fn's feelings, pretending you don't remember her. I'm the
naughty lady you talked to a little while ago.&

If my face doesn't look familiar, honey, it's 'cause you weren't looking at it when
we talked before. %fn, %ra. Pleasure to see ya again.&

It ain't been that long, %pcf. You remember your little %fn, don't cha?&

#0118
You're %fn the Fool, right? No, wait a minute, that's me. I'm terrible at names.&

I remember you! Don't tell me you forgot %fn the Jester. Woe is me. %jok.&

Who are you? Who are you? That's all I ever hear from you! I'm %fn the Fool.
Remember it next time. Sheesh.&

I memorized your name when we met before, but I threw my head away. I'm %n the
Jester. %jok.&

Wanna hear a joke? no? Too bad... %jok &

Have you heard this one before? %jok &

You talk to me, play with my affections, then the next minute, it's 'Who are you?'
Well, %ra, I may be thy old buddy %n the Jester, or I might be the %t of %cn.&

#0119
Now the first time you asked me who I am, I thought, 'What an idiot.' Now I wonder
whether I'm doing my job right. I'm %n, remember? I breath fire?&

My name is %n, the firebreather. Good to see you again, %ra.&

Are you joking? You don't remember %n the firebreather? Ah, the fleet feet of
celebrity.&

Most people don't have to ask more than once, %ra. I'm %n the firebreather.&

They call me %n the firebreather. Wait a minute, we met before. Good to see you, %ra.&

#0120
Ah, %ra, come back to talk to %n. Did you miss me or my snake, %sn?&

Whose name did you forget, %ra? %n the snake charmer, or %sn the snake? Never mind -
- it's good to see you again.&

How have you been, young %ra? Don't you remember %n the snake charmer? I am sad to
have made so little an impression.&

I am %n the greatest snake charmer in %cn. And you are a silly %ra for
forgetting my name.&

I do not spend my day playing with my snake, so that every two minutes a %ra ruffian
interrupts me with, 'Who are you?'. 'Are you %n, the snake man?' It makes me mad.&

#0121
I'm %fn, the %t of %cn, of course. Bad habit of yours, %ra. Asking old friends to
identify themselves. Makes you look lumpheaded, it does.&

Look familar, do I? Why, I'm %fn the poor, stupid mendicant, I mean beggar.&

I'm thy old pal, %fn the man o' the streets. Don't tell me you forgot.&

Someone might think you've forgotten my name, mate. But not %fn. I know demanding
'Who are you?' is just yer way of saying 'Hello, friend.'&

See how I remember thy name? Mine's poor %fn. We met before.&

#0122
My name is %n, the vendor. You're %pcf, ain't you? I think we met before.&

I'm thy solicitor %n, don't you remember? Well, it's my business to remember.&

I never forget a face. You're that %ra from before. I'm %n, the retailer.&

I cannot believe that you don't remember %n the vendor. Oh well, how are you?&

You remember me, don't you? I'm %n the monger. What can I do for you, old %ra?&

#0123
Presenting %n the merchant. Most people remember my name the first time. Oh well...&

We met before, not too long ago, young %ra. I'm the merchant %n.&

Good to see you again, %ra. I'm %n, king of merchandise, if you forgot.&

Still strolling around %cn, eh, %ra? Wish I had thy job but I gotta to eat.&

I can't believe you forgot my name, %n, supplier to %cn. I thought we had a relationship.&

#0124
I already told you, %ra. They call me %n. What d'ya want now?&

Listen, %n don't plan on making friends with no %ra. What is it?&

I told you before, %n is a busy man. Okay, what d'ya want this time?&

Can't you find anyone else to talk to? Fine, make it quick. %n is expecting some
important business any moment now.&

You already asked that before. I go by the name %n. What's yer problem now?&

#0125
Dear me if it isn't the young %ra again. You remember old %n, didn't you? Now what
can I do for you this time?&

Do I have a sign around my neck saying 'Bother Me'? I'm a cranky old wizard named
%n, not a travel guide. Make it a quick question, little one.&

You forgot my name, I remember when your average %ra had an outstanding memory.
Well, let me reintroduce myself. I am %n the Wizard. What can I do for you, youngster?&

The sorceror, %n. Surely, you have not forgotten? Adjusting to %cn life
all right, I trust.&

Ah, how soon they forget. I am the great %n, and we've met before.&

#0126
Ah, %ra, we meet again. You remember me, %n of the %tem? Of course, you do.&

Still wandering the dangerous streets of %cn, eh, %ra? Take the words of %n to
heart. Get inside before nightfall.&

Good to see you yet again, %ra. What can poor friar %n do for you this time?&

Still have not found thy way, %ra? You remember %n of the %tem, yes? Tell me how I can
help you.&

Ah the young %ra butcher again. You have not come to confess thy sins to Father
%fn this time either, have you? You just need direction.&

#0127
I know what you're going to say. 'Play it again, %n.' How are you,
%ra. It seems that I can't play three notes without you interrupting me, can I?&

This is getting to be our song, eh, %ra? Tell me what a poor lutist like %n can do
for you this time?&

It must be my name that's forgettable, not my music. Allow me to reintroduce myself
to you, %ra. I am %n of the lute. How can I help you?&

This is getting to be a bad joke. Let me complete just one song without you
interrupting me. It must be pretty important for you to bother %n more than once, I
suppose. Yes?&

Ah, my friend, don't tell me you've forgotten my name. I'm %n. To think I
was going to write a song about you entitled, 'The %ra of %hc.' But I forgive
you, good %ra.&

#0128
Little wonder you've forgotten my name, %ra. It's %n. It's one of those forgettable
names.&

You're still here, %ra? No surprise. The streets are still dirty, %n's back still
hurts. Nothing ever changes in %cn.&

Few people talk to %n more than once, %ra. Most thinks I'm crazy. Maybe you're
crazy too.&

What do you want from %n this time, %ra? Directions? Gossip? I'll tell you what I
know... which isn't much.&

Hello again, %ra. How can %n the street sweeper help a %ra like you?&

#0129
Oh, it's you again, you. Please don't touch the merchandise. Remember the motto
of %n, you break it, you bought it.&

Didn't I tell you before not to touch the slaves? If you want to talk to someone,
talk to me, %n. So what can I help you with, kid?&

Hello again, %ra. Not too morally offended by my trade to come back, are you? Don't
sweat about it. What can %n, esquire, do for you?&

Listen, %ra, you may not like what I do, but I'm %n, a businessman. I can't spend
all my time talking with %ra kids like you.&

Interested in someone up there this time, kid? Or do you just wanna pump %n for
information? I guess I already knew that one&

#0159
Nothing much is going on, as far as I know.&

You're probably asking the wrong person. I haven't heard anything interesting.&

I'm sure I haven't heard anything you'd care about.&

Sorry, I wish I had something to say but I don't.&

Well, nothing much is going on, near as I can tell you.&

Nothing I can say. %cn's been pretty quiet actually.&

I'd ask someone else with a better ear.&

Just business as usual in %cn, I guess.&

There's probably something going on elsewhere in %lp, but not here in %cn.&

I'll ask around, but I haven't heard anything lately that would interest you.&

#0160
You're looking for work? Well, that's just what we need. Another destitute %ra.&

Wish I could help you, friend. Work's hard to find in %cn.&

Ask around. I'm sure someone's heard about some kind of work.&

A healthy %ra like you? %oth, it's a shame not to have a profession at your age.&

I'd check at the inns, but I haven't heard of any jobs in days.&

I haven't heard about any jobs in a while. Sorry.&

No money, eh? It's tough to live in %cn without money.&

%oth, another homeless %ra, looking for work. Just what %cn needs.&

Wish I knew about something, %ra. Keep checking around though.&

Sorry, I can't help you. I'll keep my eye out for you however.&

#0162
Well, I heard %tg recently received this %mi from the %tq of %qc. Very
mysterious, indeed.&

Some of us are trying to make sense of a certain shipment of this %mi that %tg
received recently. A few are saying it came from %tq of %qc, but we all know that's
impossible.&

The council of %tg is furious because it turns out they received and even paid
for this forged %mi from the %tq of %qc. I'd hate to see the deliverer once they
find him.&

The %tq of %qc apparently sent this %mi to %tg here in town. Nobody, except the
%tg obviously, knows why, and most everyone is concerned.&

Apparently some %ra smuggler managed to get this %mi into %cn from %qc, into the
hands of %tg. I sure hope they work on security in this %ct.&

#0163
Did you hear our %t had to fend off an attack from %o. Thank God he had some
mercenaries to help him or %cn might have been lost.&

Most people are still talking about that attack by %o on our %t's palace. We have
that mysterious %ra to thank for saving %t %rf.&

Everyone's still talking about how we almost were under %o's rule. If it weren't for
those mercenaries that came to %t %rf's side in the hour of need, I shudder to
think.&

The big news is the assault on %t %rf's palace. They say if it weren't for a heroic
%ra, we'd probably be under %o's rule now.&

You know %t %rf made public the siege on the palace. Apparently, we were very nearly taken
over by %o. Close call, eh, %ra?&

#0164
Did you know the %r of %tq %fq is here in %cn? Wish I knew why.&

Well, you're not the only stranger in %cn. Apparently, %tq %fq's %r is in
the %ct. Apparently, %g's sightseeing, but some of us are suspicious.&

Guess who I saw in town? %tq %fq's %r, %ne! I wonder what %g's doing in %cn.&

%tq %fq's %r was over at %tl a little while ago. Someone told me %g was
there with a suspicious-looking %ra. Mysterious, eh?&

What do you suppose the %r of %tq %fq is doing in %cn? Sightseeing? I
don't think so, but we'll have to wait and see.&

#0165
Did you hear that %nc has escaped from the palace prisons? Apparently he was just about ready to go up for
court when he made a run for it. Probably halfway to %cn2 by now.&

You know that %nc was finally captured, don't you? I guess he's facing
execution soon. Can't think of a %tt that deserves it more.&

I heard %nc the %tt was just executed for crimes against the state.
I think his only crime was beating %t %rf at chess, but that's probably not true.&

Well, %nc escaped from the guards on his way to the chopping block. Apparently he's
still at large, looking for the %ra who captured him. That's one mean %tt, I'll tell
you.&

The %t %rf had that %tt killed, you know, the one that %ra captured? I hear %nc, that
was his name, made some deplorable remarks about the Emperor before he died.&

#0166
Did you know %o kidnapped the %t's %r? %g's back in %cn now, but apparently %g was
gone for weeks! Can you believe the %t kept that a secret?&

Big scandal at the palace, young %ra. It seems %t %rf's %r had been
kidnapped, for weeks maybe, and the %t did nothing but send some mercenary
after %g2. Can you imagine?&

Apparently, the %t's %r is back from the %tan, some health spa in the country. They say
%g's lost a lot of weight. That's good, I suppose.&

Some %ra rescued %t %rf's %r from some horrible place called the %tan. No one in town
even realized %g was gone, let alone kidnapped by %o. Weird, eh?&

Listen to this. The %t's %r was kidnapped by %o and imprisoned in the %tan and what
does %t %rf do? Orders some poor, stupid %ra kid to get %nr back. The palace's in an
uproar.&

#0167
Did you hear that some %ra kid killed %mn the %mt? Makes you think anything is
possible, doesn't it?&

That %mt that plagued the %ct is finally dead. We should be dancing in the
streets!&

The best huntsmen of the %t couldn't slay %mn the %mt, so %t %rf hired someone who I
hear is half %ra and half %mt and now the monster's dead! Talk about fighting fire
with fire!&

Have you heard about the %ra that killed %mn the %mt? Apparently this %ra was really
a demigod, and sprouted wings and flew away! I have it on good authority.&

Everyone in town in celebrating the death of %mn. We owe it all to a mysterious %ra
who didn't even leave a name. Well, we'll never forget him.&

#0168
Looks like there was a little scandal at the palace. I don't
know the details, but, if you can believe, the %t was nearly deposed because of
this misplaced %mi. Things are back to normal.&

I think %t %rf's on thin ice. Apparently someone discovered this %mi was missing and made a big
deal about it. Luckily, the %t just produced it. Talk about a ruler with some
enemies.&

Well, you know half the %t's Circle of Elders is dead thanks to some %ra who brought
this %mi from %qc as proof of their complicity to commit treason. Bit of excitement.&

Things have calmed down at the palace, thank God. For a while, it looked like the %t
and all the family would be executed all because of this missing %mi. Luckily it
was returned.&

Thank God that %mi was found. %t %rf was nearly executed, hadn't you heard?&

#0169
when ale flows free in all the taverns in all the cities of Tamriel.&

the biggest party of the year!&

a huge drunken orgy I really don't approve of.&

the celebration in honor of the Lovers, Polydor and Eloisa.&

#0172
when I might be cured of my... social disease at no charge.&

the holiday when disputes between neighbors are cleared up. In theory, of course.&

a good time to visit the %tem. They cure people of all sorts of diseases for free then.&

one of the two times the clerics at the %tem won't demand a donation for curing you.&

when everyone makes resolutions they never intend to keep.&

#0173
when you really have to be on the lookout for pickpockets.&

a great time to be in %cn, if you're a thief.&

a little too much revelry than I'm accustomed to.&

when everyone's a jester and a thief.&

one holiday too vulgar to be believed, in my opinion.&

#0174
when you can see every diseased %ra in %cn heading for the %tem for a free cure.&

a good time to see the clerics at the %tem if you're poisoned or sick.&

my last chance to get a free cure for my scabies at the %tem. Until next year.&

the perfect time to get your diseases cured at the %tem for free.&

when everyone is supposed to realize his own limitations, supposedly.&

#0175
when the Emperor will probably announce yet another tax increase.&

when the %tem offers blessings for half price.&

when the Emperor's heralds go all over Tamriel, mostly to announce new taxes.&

a good time to visit the %tem if you don't mind the lines, blessing are half price.&

when requested donations for blessings at the %tem are at half their usual price.&

#0176
when everyone in %cn goes shopping for the best bargains of the year.&

the best time to buy all the equipment and supplies you might need.&

when supplies most everywhere in Tamriel are half-price, by order of the Guild.&

the busiest shopping day of the year, bar none.&

a day worth spending all the money you've saved, believe me.&

#0177
when all the stores in %cn, maybe in all Tamriel, are closed.&

a day worth remembering, 'cause you can't do any shopping then.&

when everyone goes crazy, because there's not a shop open in all %cn.&

the day the business quarter of %cn looks utterly deserted.&

#0179
when magical items are half price in the Mages Guild.&

#0180
the day the temples and Mages Guild vie for attention. Guess whose side I'm on.&

when you can get any item evaluated for mystic potential at the Mages Guild for free.&

when this %ct is filled to her edges with Mages, Nightblades, and Spellswords.&

a good day to buy a cheap spell scroll at the Mages Guild if you get there early.&

when every temples in Tamriel is open all night long to combat evil.&

#0181
when we had parades and hunts ... in the good old days.&

the day the aristocrats in %cn used to have the horseback Goblin Chase in the old days.&

not the Emperor's real birthday - it's all symbolic, you know.&

when everyone celebrates in the taverns.&

in honor of the Emperor's forty-somethingth year in Tamriel.&

#0182
a good time to pick up a sword or whatever cheap in one of the equipment stores.&

when all weapons in all equipment stores are half price.&

the day when the warriors of %cn test their mettle, unfortunately in the streets.&

a truly barbaric celebration of warfare.&

the perfect time to buy a weapon you couldn't ordinarily afford.&

#0183 the
holiest day of the year, in my opinion.&

when you can get blessed, cured, healed, the works in the %tem for half price.&

a day of thanksgiving.&

when the %tem ask only half the usual donation for any of the services there.&

a pretty good time to get fixed up by the %tem for a reasonable donation.&


#0184
when all prepare for the real party - New Life, the next day.&

the day we ask forgiveness for old sins, before committing new ones.&

a day of rest before New Life, which is one big party.&

a good time to go to the temple of your choice.&

when even unpopular temples in %cn are packed with people.&

#0185
I do not want to sound paranoid, but I am convinced that our %t has been possessed
by the devil.&

This %ct is crawling with undead after dark. Be armed at all times!&

I do not have any proof of this, but you must believe me. I know %t %rf is an
imposter. Not only that, %g is a cannibal too.&

I heard from a member of the Council of Elders that we will not be at %st with %cn2
for much longer.&

A couple of my friends in the know say the %st talks with %cn2 this week did not go very well.&

This town is crawling with spies from %cn2. Beware, young %ra.&

This year's harvest looks like the best ever.&

This year's harvest looks great. There should be a lot of celebrating.&

The good news is that this year's harvest looks as good as last year's.&

It seems this year's harvest is going to be as good as last year's.& 

Rumor has it there is a plague in Skyrim.&

My aunt just returned from a little village on the edge of Elsweyr that has been
almost completely ravaged by a plague.&

The prophet I see tells me that Hammerfell will be decimated by plague early
next year.&

I heard that some lord in a High Rock village angered his patron spirit this week.
The local shaman forsees a plague over all the province within the month.&

They say Morrowind is doomed to wither away from plague and pestilence this year or
next. My opinion is good riddance.&

There's a physician of some sort in the wilds of Valenwood who found a cure for
lycanthropy. Can you imagine? I didn't even know it was a problem.&

My prophet says Summurset Isle is doomed to sink beneath the sea. He did not specify
when, but it sounded like soon.&

Well, they say a plague has been reported in some remote Summurset shore villages.
My sources are dubious, so I could not vouch for the truth.&

You will not be surprised to hear a plague is ravaging Black Marsh. What else is
new, you know?&

Mark my words, %ra. The Elder Gods are coming and Black Marsh will burn for its sins.&

Have you heard about the Afterdark Society? Those nonhuman heathen they meet every
night in front of the %tem.&

Some friends of mine went out searching for the Staff of Magnus, but
they disappeared. The fools.&

The %t had a visitor, a foreign scholar tracing the history of Arrovan,
the thief who wielded the Skeleton's Key. Apparently, Arrovan stole some
stuff from the royal family here in %cn!&

Some guy was here last week, trying to sell information about the Ring of
Phynaster, like we're the sort of fools to believe in such things.&

Of course, on %nhd is %nh. It's %hod&

You know %nh is coming up on %nhd. That's %hod&

I can't believe it's time for %nh. You know, that's %nhd, %hod&

Well, you must know %nh is coming soon. %nhd, actually. You know, that's %hod&

I wasn't here in %cn last year for %nh, but I should be here on %nhd this year for
%hod&


#0186
Can you %qt? I heard someone in the %di was looking for someone to do that.&

Now, what was it that I heard? Someone in the %di needed someone to, ah...
I've forgotten. Listen, go %di and ask around. Lots of people are
talking about it.&

I heard that someone was looking for someone to %qt. I don't know the details, but
I think this character's %di of here somewhere.&

Nothing much going on around here, to be honest. Over %di, I've heard, someone needs
someone to %qt. If you're interested, I'd head in that direction.&

Right. Here in %cn but way off to the %di, I know there's someone looking for a %ra
like you to %qt. I paid little attention when I heard, but you might want to look
into it.&

Here's what you do. Go %di and ask someone else what's going on. That's all I can say.&

If you're in the mood to walk, go %di a ways. There's always something going on
in one of the taverns up there. Maybe even something profitable.&

I wouldn't waste my time down here. If you want to make a few gold pieces, head %di
as far as you can go. There's always some deal being made over there.&

I haven't heard of much going on here. But you might want to try to the %di. It seems
like I heard someone was looking for an adventuring %ra like you up there.&

I'd head %di if I were looking for something to do. The taverns there are full
of people looking to hire adventurers.&

#0187
Listen to me carefully, %ra. There's a tavern just %di of here, the name of which
escapes me. Look for a %ds, looking for someone just like you.&

Ever done any delivery work? Well, no matter. There's a %ds in a tavern just %di of
here. This character isn't very demanding, just needs a bit of help.&

Now, you didn't hear it from me, but I have a friend, a %ds, who was here a little
while ago, looking for someone to deliver something. I suggest you head %di.&

I wasn't told any details, but there was a %ds here earlier, looking for someone to
help out with an odd job. You ought to check the taverns to the %di.&

There's a tavern %di of here. I've forgotten the name but apparently, someone
is looking for a delivery agent. Might mean a few gold pieces for you, if you're
willing.&

#0188
I was just talking to a %ds, who was looking for someone to get something.
Didn't give any more details than that. You might look %di in the taverns.&

An acquaintance of mine knows a %ds looking for someone willing to get, or steal,
something in some inn to the %di, if you have any interest.&

I don't know if you want to make a couple gold pieces, but I've heard there's a %ds
to the %di, looking for some help. Needs someone to pick up something.&

Not far from here, just %di in fact, you'll find a %ds. I don't know what needs
doing, whether it's legal or not, but I bet it'll pay well.&

The best I can tell you is to head %di. I understand someone in one of the taverns
there has been looking for anyone willing to do a little recovery work. Maybe someone like you.&

#0189
Doubt if you've had much experience in this, but I know a %ds looking for a
guard. I think %g's usually in one of the taverns %di of here, if you're interested.&

I don't know if %g would mind me mentioning it, but I know a %ds who's
having a little trouble and might need some protection. I'm pretty sure
%g's to the %di somewhere, I think.&

If you want to earn a few gold pieces and don't mind a little honest
fighting, be on the lookout for a %ds to the %di. I'm pretty sure %g's
looking for a few bodyguards.&

Ever heard of a %ds? Well, if you had, you'd know %g's always having some trouble.
This time I think it's pretty serious. I'm pretty sure %g's somewhere %di of here,
if you're looking for work.&

I don't know anything about this character, but apparently %g's looking for some
protection in one of the taverns %di of here. You could make a few gold pieces if
you're willing to fight.&

#0190
Don't say you heard it from me, but if you go %di and find a %ds, there'll
be some work for you. I remember being told this %ds was looking for someone
tough to protect a relative or something.&

Rumor has it there's a %ds %di of here, looking for someone to escort some relative
or something. Might mean a few gold pieces for you if you've got the time.&

You might be interested in this: a %ds in some tavern just %di of here needs someone
to watch over a friend or a relative. Sounds like easy money for a tough %ra.&

I don't know the name, but someone in a tavern a bit %di of here has been asking
around for an escort. Wish I could give you more details, but that's all I know.&

Heard anything about a %ds? Not too far away, looking
for anyone with experience escorting. Might mean a pretty hunk of gold.&

#0191
Looking for work? Well, there's a tavern right to the %di called the %nt where a %ds has
been asking for someone to make a delivery. I'd look into it, if I were you.&

Here's what you do. Go to the %nt, that's just %di of here, and ask for a %ds.
I'm pretty sure there's a job for a tough %ra like you. There's no such thing
as a simple delivery job though, you know?&

I know for a fact there's a %ds with a job doing a delivery that was made for you.
Just %di of here, at the %nt. Don't say I sent you.&

Here's a sure thing: a delivery job for some %ds. You can't miss this
character. Over at the %nt, a few steps %di of here.&

Now, you didn't hear it from me, but go check out the %nt to the %di if you think you
might be interested in a delivery job. Ask for a %ds.&

#0192
Don't know if this'll interest you, but it's got income potential. Just %di of here
is the %nt. Look for a %ds, checking out all the tough-looking characters
who walk in.&

I've heard there's a %ds over at the %nt, that's just %di of here, looking for someone
who can find some lost thing. From what I've heard, the job'll pay very well
for whatever it is.&

How would like to recover something for a friend of mine, a %ds? You can find
this person at the %nt, you know the inn %di of here? I'm sure you'll be
paid nicely.&

There's a %ds at the %nt %di of here who asked me to recover something. I don't
have time to do it, you know, because of my career. But if you want to do it, I'm
sure you'll be welcome.&

You might want to pay a visit a little %di of here to the %nt. A %ds may still
be there,
looking for someone to get some kind of object. If you're looking for
work, it's not bad.&

#0193
The word from the %nt - you know the tavern a bit %di of here? - is that a %ds is in some
serious trouble and looking for protection. If you don't mind fighting, look into it.&

Listen, I have a friend, a %ds, who's in a little misunderstanding with some rough
types, and is looking for someone to protect %g2. You can find %g2 just %di of here,
at the %nt.&

I've heard there's a %ds at the %nt who's anticipating some trouble from one of the
rougher elements of %cn. The inn's just %di of here, if you think you're tough enough
to defend %g2.&

Wanna fight for money? The word is that a couple tough characters are planning an
attack on a %ds. I'm pretty sure %g's looking for some defenders over at a tavern
just %di of here called the %nt.&

I don't even know if this %ds knows it, but a %ds has made some big enemies in %cn.
If you go see %g2 at the %nt, just a few steps %di of here, I'm sure %g'll pay for some
protection.&

#0194
You know the %nt, just %di of here? Well, there's a %ds there, talking to people about
escorting some family member, right here in %cn. I'd look
into it.&

I don't know if this %ds needs a chaperone or an escort or what, but if you go %di a bit, you'll find a %ds in the %nt looking for someone
like that. I guess willing to pay generously.&

Here's all I know. Just %di of here there's a inn called the %nt where you'll find
a %ds. Apparently, this character's looking for some sort of bodyguard or escort...&

A friend of mine, this %ds, is looking for somebody tough to escort someone.
I'm sure you'll get all the details over at the %nt. That's the inn directly to
the %di.&

A good bet for a job is this %ds %di of here at the %nt, looking for someone
to escort a relative or something. Oughta be desperate by now, so the
price will be good.&

#0196
Sorry, I don't think there's anything
available for someone of your talents.&

Don't think I can't help you, %ra.&

Wish I could help you. You might try just asking people on the
streets. Most of us in %cn are pretty friendly.&

Work's scarce in %cn. Keep asking around on the
streets.&

I haven't heard of anything to do that you're quite qualified for.&

Sorry, I wish I could help you.&

Ask around on the street. Lots of folk have a better idea than I.&

Sometimes the %t hires adventurers like you, but not lately.&

No, no one here has heard of a job in weeks.&

You've come to the wrong tavern. We don't know about any jobs.&

#0197
Listen, friend, some of the %t's men are regulars in here and
they was talking about something going on at the palace. Seems like they was
whispering something about %t %rf looking for a mercenary to do a delivery job for
%g2. Maybe %g'll be interested in hiring you, %ra. I'd at least go to the
palace and see.&

Well, if my buddies are reliable, and they always is, there might be a job made for
you up the road a ways. It's a delivery job, you know, but not just any
delivery job. It's for the %t of %cn, no less. If I were
you, I'd go to the palace and see if %g's interested in your expertise. &

You bet I've heard something. Don't breath a word
about this, %ra, but %t %rf's looking for a tough character just like you up at the
palace. I heard about it from one of the guards. Don't know what it's all about, but
I bet it'll be worth your while, you know what I mean?&

Well, I've heard a rumor that %t %rf is looking for a tough %ra like you to...
well, you'll have to go and see. I can't say any more as a patriotic %cn
citizen except you should go to the palace and inquire. As soon as possible.&

I have a good friend over at the
palace who told me to keep an eye out for tough-looking adventurers who know how to
keep their mouths shut. All I can tell you is if you go to the palace today, and the
%t likes you, you've got a lucrative little job possibility. Regardless, we've never
had this conversation, right?&

#0198
Well, you can always check the palace. The %t of %cn is always
looking for someone to pick up something from this town and bring it to another, and
then take these two things in exchange for another in some little village. Colossal
waste of time, of course, but pretty profitable for the right adventurer. Maybe you'd
like it?&

Oh, I'd go to the palace if I were you.
You know, seek an audience with %t %rf. If %g likes you, %g'll find something for
you to do.&

Do I know a job for you, young %ra? I can't tell you all the details, but
suffice it to say, %t %rf's
really screwed up. I'm pretty sure %g's lost something that belongs to the %ct, to be honest, I'm
not sure what, but %g needs someone to get it back. Trust me, %g'll be happy to see
an freelancer in the palace.&

The %t of %cn is in serious trouble. If someone doesn't help %g2, the wickedest people in
the palace will take over. I know only a little bit more, but you'll have to go to
the %t's audience chamber in the palace. It was dangerous for me to tell you as much
as I have.&

I haven't heard of any positions available in the palace in weeks, The innkeeper
shakes his head. You might want to seek an audience with %t %rf personally at the
palace. If that sleazy Circle of Elders will even let you in, that is.&

#0199
Listen, honey. My husband's a guard at the palace of good %t %rf. I shouldn't be telling you this,
'cause I'm not even supposed to know it, but they're preparing for a battle or
something up there. I'm sure the %t would be happy to pay you if you were willing to
fight. I just want me man to be out alive.&

I don't care what anyone says, there's something going on at the palace, something we common folk ain't supposed to
know. Preparations for war, if I ever seen it, and I fought in two campaigns against
%cn2. If you're smart you'll head up to the palace and see what %t %rf's willing to
pay a soldier.&

I'm only telling you this 'cause I like you. There were three of %t %rf's soldiers in here a bit ago, having a drink, and I
accidentally overheard them talking about an expected siege on the %cn palace! They
sounded like they expected to be outnumbered. I bet if you went to the palace, the
%t'd be willing to pay for your help.&

You look like you're accustomed to battle, %ra, so you're the
type the captain of the guard told me to keep an eye out for. The %t of %cn's looking
for soldiers for some reason. I wasn't told why. I was only told to send any
toughlooking characters up to the palace. If you're really looking for a job, head up
that direction, %ra.&

You ought to head up to the palace, kid. I'm friendly with a
couple of the boys in %t %rf's guard and I haven't seen them in a couple days. That
usually means something's going on at the palace. And when's there's something going
on, there's work. %t %rf ain't cheap, neither. You'll get paid good for whatever
you do for %g2.&

#0200
Well, I can tell you I just waited on a couple mercenaries like yourself who told me
%t %rf up at the palace is definitely looking for someone. Maybe you're more
the type. It won't hurt you any to head up to the palace and see, right?&

I think I might have something for you. I know the %t personally. Grew up
with %g2 right here in %cn. I remember %g's looking for someone brave, strong,
and trustworthy for a little mission. I can't tell you anything more, but if
you get to the palace while %g's in audience, you'll hear it all.&

Well, there's no official word on it from the palace, but the rumor is %t
%rf's looking for someone to do something sorta covert for %g2.
Knowing the %t's family, I have a few suspicions. You should head up to the
palace while %t %rf's in the audience chamber and inquire. But you didn't
hear about it from me.&

You're a smart %ra, ain't you, coming to talk to me about work? You musta heard I
know the ins and outs up at the palace. The %t of %cn's looking for an escort to, ah, escort
someone, %g is. You look like the strong, trusty type %g'd be interested in. You
oughta go to the palace and see the %t.&

Without compromising my friendship with the good %t of %cn, I can't tell you
everything I know, but I think %g's looking for someone who's more than tough,
someone who's trustworthy and valorous to act as escort for %g2. Go to the
audience chamber in the palace if you're interested. If you're not, keep your
mouth shut.&

#0201
Ever heard tale of %nc? Wickedest %tt in %lp. Rumor is %t %rf's finally getting mercenaries to hunt him
down. If it's true, the %t's going to be doing all the hiring at the palace. Fame and
fortune, %ra. Better get there while %t %rf's in the audience chamber.&

%oth, I've heard about something that might interest you, %ra, the
barkeep grins.
If you want to make a few gold pieces, win the admiration of all %cn, and bring a
very evil %tt to justice, that is. Go to the palace today while the audience
chamber's still open and talk to %t %rf. Tell %g2 I sent you.&

Kid, all I can tell you is there's work for you up at the palace if you want it.
I wouldn't want it, but I'm not a fighting man. You should know before you go up
there, the %t of %cn's looking for someone to catch the meanest, toughest
%tt in %lp. If you're looking for something easy, don't even apply.&

Well, %oth, looking for work, eh, %ra? Well, if you want fame and fortune,
and an almost certain chance of being killed in a very unpleasant way, head up to the
palace and talk to %t %rf. I'm being completely serious. If you're really tough, you
can't lose.&

Well, I've heard something about a manhunt the %t of %cn's organizing. Rumor
has it the %t's going after %nc, but I don't believe any money's worth that.
Anyhow, you should head over to the palace and find out the story for
yourself.&

#0202
I think the %t's looking for someone over at the palace. I
don't know why, but if %g's receiving visitors in the audience chamber, %g can tell
it all to you.&

Okay, kid, listen carefully, he whispers, There's serious trouble up at the palace.
No one in the %ct knows completely what's going on, but the %t's %r hasn't been seen
in some time and, well, if you're looking to do something, head to the palace and make
inquiries; and keep your mouth shut about this place.&

Well, there's been a lot of whispering about some scandal in the palace, about the
%t's %r. Everyone knows that where there's a scandal, there's
work to be had. If you want to straighten out %t %rf's affairs, get over to the
palace and ask %g2 yourself.&

I don't know if there's any truth to the rumors that there's trouble up at the %t of
%cn's palace. The innkeeper turns away from his patrons. I don't encourage
rumormongering in my inn. But if you want to chase a possible scandal, go seek an
audience with the %t. It can't hurt to check, I suppose.&

Looking for work, let me see. %oth, someone was telling me something about the %t just a
minute ago. What was it? I suppose that %g was looking to hire someone
for a quest of some kind. Top secret, no doubt. You should go to the palace and talk
to %t %rf yourself. I think %g'll know what's going on.&

#0203
Well, if I had the money, I'd hire you myself to go kill %mn, that bloody %mt that
feeds on our %ct like a bloody leech, The innkeeper breaks a glass in his anger. No
one wants to visit %cn while that %mt is around. Tell you what, go volunteer for the
%t's huntsmen. If you kill %mn, you're not a volunteer, but a hero worthy of rewards
beyond the wildest avarice.&

Go to the palace and seek audience with %t %rf. Tell %g2 the bartender at the %nt sent
you. Tell %g2 I said you were the right
kind of %ra to take on %mn. Have you heard of %mn? Well, no matter. You're going to
get rich on this, kid, and you'll have me to thank.&

Do I know about a job for you? The innkeeper snorts unattractively. %oth, I do. Go
find the %mt that ate my fiancee. Well first go to the palace and ask the %t about
%mn. That's the %mt, not the %t's name. Anyhow, ask %g2 the wherebouts of this
monster, and I betcha %g'll make it worth your while financially.&

Have you been up to the palace yet? I've heard %t %rf is finally getting 
serious about the %mn problem. I've heard the %mt actually attacked the %t's
daughter while she was having a picnic, so now %g's angry. Well, be that as
it may, you ought to go to the palace and see if you can get a job as a
%mt hunter.&

Well, I know for a fact the %t of %cn's looking for a hunter. For what, you ask?
Some sort of %mt named %mn, if you can believe it. I
doubt it even exists, but if it does and you kill it, you'll be bathing in gold
pieces for weeks. If I'm right and there's no %mn, at least you can explore the
beautiful %lp countryside.&

#0204
Ever hear word of the Armor of Morihaus? That's what the old timers call the Lord's
Mail. Well, anyhow, there's someone over in the %nt whispering around about the Armor of
Morihaus. Sure, he might've just been some drunk talking and about old legends, but if
there's a chance of getting the armor that regenerates the person who wears it, well...&

Listen, some guy over at the %nt, that inn to the %di, told me he knew not only that the
Lord's Mail of Morihaus is real, but how to find it. He said he was willing to sell
the information, but I'm more than a little broke. You ought to head up that way if you've got a
couple hundred gold, and are willing to trust a stranger.&

Actually, I have heard something interesting lately. Ever heard the legend of
Morihaus? Well, this guy over to the %di in the %nt says he knows where Morihaus' armor,
the Lord's Mail is. I don't know if it's even half true, but I know he wants money
for his information. If you've got the gold, this is an opportunity I'd take
advantage of.&

#0205
Well, there is a interesting little story I heard a few minutes ago from some chap
in a tavern just %di of here called the %nt. He said there was this book of incredible power called the
Oglmethlum, uh... the Utherlzninium... the Uglonmth... the Oghma Infinium, that's it.
Anyhow, he knows how to get to this book, but he wants some gold in return.&

Ever heard of Xarses, the sorceror who created the tome, the Oghma Infinium? Well,
there's a guy in the %nt, just %di of here, who swears he knows someone who knew the
great, great granduncle of this maid who used to clean up for Xarses' sister-in-law,
and he says he knows how to find the Infinium. But he's going to want gold to talk.&

Some guy at the %nt was telling anyone who'd listen that he knows how to get this
book, the Oghma Infinium, that supposedly will make you twice the %ra you are now. If
you're interested, he's probably still there, just %di of here. Personally, I think
he was just drunk.&

#0206
There's yet another rumor going around about Chrysamere, you know, the Paladin's
Blade. Well, this guy at the %nt, a little tavern just %di of here, is telling everyone
he has information about where Chrysamere is. He sounded sincere, I guess.
Maybe if I had the gold to pay for the information, I'd go after Chrysamere myself.&

You've heard of the Chrysamere Blade, of course? Who hasn't? Well, some shadylooking
character %di of here at the %nt is saying he'll sell information regarding its location
for a price. Apparently, his price is pretty steep. If you've got the money and the
inclination, you should pay a visit to the %nt.&

Nothing much. Some drunk's offering to sell what he knows about the location of
Chrysamere at the %nt %di of here, as if he'd really know where the Paladin's Blade is.
And he has the nerve to ask for hundreds of gold pieces in exchange. Maybe it's true,
I don't know. If you're the trusting sort, you might want to visit the %nt.&

#0207
Well, I've been talking to this fellow at the %nt %di of here, and he was telling me he
knows something about the location of the Staff of Magnus. I don't know if he's telling
the truth, but he had the nerve to ask for hundreds of gold pieces in return for the
information. If I had the money I think I'd take him up on it.&

This %ct's getting crazier and crazier, that's what's up. For example, you know the %nt
just %di of here? Perfectly respectable tavern, but apparently some lunatic is
hanging around there, bothering everyone, telling them he knows how to find the Staff
of Magnus. He should know anyone who's ever heard of the Staff is too senile to go
after it anyhow.&

Ever hear of the Staff of Magnus? No offense, very few %ra kids your age have. It's
this ancient relic that legend says can absorb a spell cast at it and give the
spell's power to whoever holds it. I know someone who knows how to get the Staff, and
he'll tell you for a price if you get to him today. He's at the %nt, just %di of here.&

#0208
Maybe your father told you stories of Volendrung, %ra? The Hammer of the Dwarves of
Rourken? There's some guy a few inns from here who claims to know its location.
Times being tough in %cn, he's over at the %nt, a tavern just %di of here,
selling the information he knows. You ought to look into it.&

Crazy %ct this %cn. Saw a guy skulking around, whispering 'Volendrung, volendrung',
whatever that means. I chased him off, the crazy bastard. He headed %di toward the
%nt, thank God. See what I mean, this %ct's just getting crazier.&

There's this guy just %di of here, in a tavern called the %nt, selling information
about Volendrung. If he's telling the truth, he knows how to get the Hammer
of Might so I guess he's justified in asking hundreds of gold pieces for the
information. A hammer that can turn a man to stone, imagine...&

#0209
%oth, I wish I were a few hundred gold pieces richer. If I were, I would've give it
to this guy I was just talking to. He said he had information about Spell Breaker,
that shield that dispells spells. You know, we have those reckless
battlemages here in %cn throwing fireballs around. If you're interested,
he was heading %di toward the %nt.&

I know every other person has a theory about where the Spell Breaker shield
has resurfaced, but there's a guy right here in %cn who says he definitely
knows how to get it. He's going to want some gold for his information,
but if you're interested, I saw him %di of here in a tavern called the %nt.&

There's another chap trying to get people to pay him for his so called
insider information about the newest wherebouts of Spell Breaker. I'm sure
he makes a good living, selling phony stories to people who want to believe
in a shield that can destroy spells! Last I saw of him, he was %di of here,
bothering the people at the %nt. %oth, there ought to be a law.&

#0210
If go %di a little and to a little tavern called the %nt, you'll find this shady
character who says he knows how to find some old relic, the legendary
Necromancer's Amulet or something. Suppose he's telling the truth: the Amulet
is supposed to regenerate any mage's power, and to give the user protection better
than plate mail without the weight. If I had time, I'd be the first in line.&

%oth, if you know a mage interested in having his power regenerated,
you might want to make a small investment over at the %nt,
that's a tavern %di of here. Look for a shady looking chap, you can't miss
him, and ask him about the Necromancer's Amulet. Heard of it? Well, he'll
probably tell you all you need to know.&

%oth, you'd think mages would be too logical to get involved in quests
for mythical relics that'll supposedly make them incredibly powerful. I saw
two mages over at the %nt, a respectable inn %di of here, bartering with
this guy over the Necromancer's Amulet. They didn't have enough money for
the information he had, lucky for them.&

#0211
Were you ever told stories about Auriel when you were a little %ra? There's
this guy %di of here at the %nt who says he knows how to get Auriel's Shield,
which apparently gives you some of Auriel's powers to resist spells and heal.
He wants a few hundred gold pieces more than I have for his information,
but if you have the money, you really shouldn't pass up this opportunity.&

Just between the two of us, I know how to get Auriel's Shield. Actually, I
know how to get to the guy who can sell you information about where to go to
find the map to find the shield, if you follow me. He's a little %di of here,
in a tavern called the %nt. Tell him I sent you, and bring plenty of gold.
He's not giving his information away.&

Somebody ought to open up an Auriel Shoppe for tourists, he'd make a million. Now
there's some chap %di of here who says for a couple hundred gold, he'll tell you how
to find the map to the new locale of Auriel's Shield. If he's honest, it's
the find of the year. If not, he's just one more con man in the %nt.
I wouldn't risk it.&

#0212
The moral climate of the %ct is plunging, I tell you. I was just solicited in a
reputable tavern %di of here, the %nt, by a scary-looking fellow who offered to sell me
information concerning the Ebony Blade. When I asked him what the Ebony Blade is,
he said it's this sword that gives the wielder the victim's strength,
sort of like a vampire! Can you imagine? %oth!&

Well, do you want to hear a sign of the times? There's a gentleman over at the %nt,
that's a good-sized tavern to the %di, who says he knows where the map leading to the
Ebony Blade is. If he really does, that's the sort of information one would only sell
to the richest city-state Kings or the Emperor. But here he is in a %cn inn,
practically giving it away.&

%oth, I know where you need to be, %ra. There's a tavern a bit %di by name of the %nt where
you'll find a peculiar character selling information about the Ebony Blade. It is
said that he who wields the Blade grows mightier each time his foe grows weaker.
Might be a nice thing to have if you're anticipating a fight, eh?&

#0213
I've heard that there's some guy in town who knows the newest wherebouts of one of the
surviving relics of the Arch-Warlock Syrabane, a ring or something. I
bet he's going to ask for a lot of money in exchange for the information, but the
Warlock's Ring is supposed to be quite powerful. He's in the %nt
to the %di, if you're interested.&

If the Mages Guild or the Necromancers knew he was here, his life wouldn't be worth
a copper, but over to the %di at the %nt you'll find a chap who knows how to find the
lost Ring of the Warlock. I'm certain he'll want some money for his information,
but I couldn't say exactly how much. Whatever amount, it's worth it.&

Ever hear tale of the Arch-Warlock Syrabane who once saved %lp, in fact, all of
Tamriel? Well, there's a gent over %di at the %nt who says he knows how to find
Syrabane's ring. If he's telling the truth, any amount of gold is worth his
information. The Ring of the Warlock has all the defensive power of Syrabane if
you can wield it.&

#0214
Auriel's Bow is the news, young %ra. Ever heard of it? Well, there's a chap just %di
of here who swears he knows exactly how to find it. He's asking for a bit more than
the local %nt boys are interested in paying. Maybe you could talk him down a bit, if
you're interested in the ultimate bow in Tamriel.&

Another of Auriel's artifacts has turned up, at least according to this gentleman
over at the %nt, just %di of here. He says he knows who has the map to Auriel's Bow,
which legend says never misses. If you have the sort of money he's looking for, you
should pay a visit. But you better hurry over. I don't know if he'll be at the %nt
for long.&

Nothing much going on I can think of. Unless you count that weird guy I saw here a
few minutes ago, trying to sell me information on buying Auriel's Bow for more gold
pieces than I care to spend on a rumor. I told him he might try the locals at the %nt, so
headed off %di. If you're interested, you can find him there.&

#0215
%oth, some character just asked me if I were willing to pay for information
regarding the wherebouts of the Skeleton's Key. As if I'd like it to be found! You
want my opinion, a key capable of opening any lock or portal would make all %lp
unsafe. I told him to get lost and he headed over %di to the %nt. I hope no one takes his
offer.&

Yeah, this was a little odd. My grandmother told me stories when I was young about
a magical key called the Skeleton's Key with which one could open anything.
I never believed her, but just today, %di of here, this man offered to sell me
information to the location of the Skeleton's Key. He was over in the %nt.&

I don't know if I believe it, but there's a gentleman in %cn who says he knows how
to find the magical key of Arrovan, the master thief. He wants money for the
information - a lot of money - but if you'd like to be able to break into anything
you might want to head %di to the %nt and talk to him.&

#0216
You know who Phynaster was, don't you? He was a %ra, like yourself, with a marvelous
ring that allowed him invulnerability to magic and poison. Rumor is there's a
gentleman in the %nt - that's %di of here - who says he knows how to get to this ring. He's
in it for the money, make no mistake. You want his information, you better have
gold.&

Can't say I've ever heard of him, but some guy named Phynaster apparently lost his
ring and another guy %di of here in the %nt knows how to get it back. Must be something
special about that ring, %ra, because he's asking for a lot of money for his
information. Enough gold to buy a modest-sized palace, actually. But if you're
interested, there you are.&

Just more rumors about the Ring of Phynaster, this time from a man to the %di,
at the %nt actually. Chap says he'll tell you exactly how to get the Ring if the price
is right. Not for me, %ra. I don't need total invulnerability to magic and poison.&

#0217
Well, if you're able to spend some gold in order to make a lot of gold, I have a
deal for you. There's a chap a bit to the %di in the %nt who knows how to get to King
Orgnum's Coffer. If you've never heard about the coffer, it's the magical item that
keeps on giving. Head toward the %nt right away because I don't know how long this guy
will be there.&

Some chap %di of here in the %nt is making a profit that would make King Orgnum himself
proud. He says he knows where Orgnum's magical coffer is, but he needs several
hundred gold pieces to say. Despicable, in my opinion.&

It never ceases to amuse me how much money people will spend to get rich quick. If
you want to see what I mean, go %di to the %nt. If he hasn't left yet, there's a man
there willing to tell you how to find King Orgnum's Coffer, the key to a lifetime of
wealth - for a price. Don't bring any money with you if you go or he'll
talking you out of it all.&

#0218
If you have aspirations toward going far, %pcf, you need to talk to a
man I know who has information about getting the Ebony Mail. Go a bit %di to the %nt if
you want to see him, but remember to bring plenty of gold. He's not giving it away
for nothing, that's for certain.&

%oth, I know about something you'd be interested in, young %ra. Over to the %di in
an inn called the %nt, you'll find a gentleman with a certain inside story about the
Ebony Mail. I'm sure you've heard about the Mail? Makes you tougher than a
troll, stronger, faster. Might have some use, you know?&

Now, keep this under your hat, %ra, but I know someone who knows how to get the
Ebony Mail, really I do. He's %di of here in the %nt. If I were you, I get all the gold I
have for payment and get there right away, before all the battle-hardies of %cn
and %cn2 are at the %nt looking for this guy.&

#0219
I don't know what to make of him, but there's a gent over at the %nt who swears he knows
how to find the Ring of the Khajiiti. Now how someone could know where the ring is
and not have it is beyond me. Everyone could find a use for the Ring, you know. Well, if
you're curious, you'll find the %nt a bit %di of here.&

Ever heard of Rajhin, the great Khajiiti thief? Possibly not, for he stole much more
than he was ever blamed for. Partly that was his skill, partly his magical ring.
Rumor has it there's a chap %di of here at the %nt who knows how to find where the ring has
resurfaced if you have the time to investigate and the money to pay him for his
information.&

You know that ring, the Ring of the Khajiiti that's supposed to turn anyone who
wears it invisible? Well, I was talking to a gentleman who's staying just %di of here
at the %nt and he says he knows where the Ring is. Or, maybe he said he knew where to get
to the map. He wanted more money for his information that I have, but you might be
interested.&

#0220
Couldn't help overhearing you, mate. You
can call me %an. I happen to know how to find Morihaus' armor, the bane of trolls
everywhere. A %ra like you could use a little help. I'm willing to tell
you everything I know for %oap gold. Agreed?&

It can't be coincidence that brings you and I to the %nt at the same time. 
Best armor ever created, make you more than a match for anyone. I like you
enough to offer a mere %oap gold pieces for my invaluable information.
Do we have a deal? &

I've got the sort of information wars
have been waged over. You know for his arrogance Morihaus had the Lord's Mail taken
from him by the spirit Kynareth. I do not suffer from the same sin of arrogance. For
%oap gold, I will tell how to find the place where Kynareth has sequestered the
Lord's Mail. Shall we do business, %ra? &

#0240
Very good, I accept your gold. Listen to me carefully. In the province
of Skyrim, there is a dungeon called the %amn, said to be the actual burial
crypt of Kynareth herself! Before her death it is said that she foresaw
many needs coming to the land. To aid any person who would take such
a need upon their shoulders Kynareth created the Lord's Mail, said to be
able to cure its wearer of any injury. To guard this artifact from those
who would plunder her crypt, she secreted it in a location known only to her.
Whenever a great need appears upon the land, so does the
Lord's Mail. That's how that warrior, Morihaus, got it first.
Its location, and the crypt of Kynareth are always different.
In the ancient libraries of Tholgamis I stumbled upon the secret to the
location of Kynareth's crypt as it has appeared this time. I have no desire
to be a hero. A full purse is enough to keep me happy! If you fashion
yourself a hero, and wish to win the Lord's Mail, journey to Kynareth's
crypt and get the map, good %ra. I have inscribed her resting place on
your map of the continent. I wish you well on your journey...&

#0221
Rather a strange thing for someone to ask about. The Oghma Infinium does not roll of one's tongue
accidentally. Perhaps you have heard one of the %cn folk mention %an - that's me. I
do know how to find the Tome of Power, only occasionally seen since Xarses' death centuries
ago. I regret the necessity of asking %oap gold for my information. You do agree it's a
reasonable request for such a powerful relic? &

My name is %an. Sorry for interrupting, but you
mentioned the Oghma Infinium, and I have information that could lead to its recovery.
You know knowledge doesn't come without its price. Mine is %oap gold pieces. Are
you willing to go on? &

Did I hear correctly? You're looking for the Tome of Power, the
Librum of Knowledge, the Oghma Infinium of Xarses itself? I, %an, admire ambition, so
I will tell you exactly how you can get the Infinium for a mere %oap gold. Agreed? &

#0241
Excellent. In the province of Skyrim lies an ancient tomb. I found it quite
by accident while escaping Reavers of the frozen wastes who sought to enslave
me. Falling into this forsaken place I found tablets and scrolls which all
pointed to the location of the Oghma Infinium, said to increase the reader's
innate attributes to god-like proportions. I have no need of such attention,
for I would rather be rich and anonymous. I have however inscribed the
location of that tomb onto your map of the continent. It's called the %amn.
Journey there and you can recover those maps for yourself. They will show
you where the Oghma Infinium now lies. Be warned, these things of power
seldom grant their gifts without a price. The Infinium has appeared many
times through the ages. I wish you luck on recovering it as it appears now...&


#0222
I am %an, and I know how to find the holy Sword of the Paladin, Chrysamere. I'm a
businessman and my information doesn't exactly come cheap, %ra. You'll know
everything I know about Chrysamere for %oap gold pieces. Are we agreed on price? &

Good %ra, allow me to introduce myself, %an at your service. I couldn't
help overhearing your mention of the Blade of Blades, the Sword of the Paladin,
Chrysamere. As a matter of fact, I happen to know where the map to
Chrysamere's most recent hiding place has been all this time. I just turned down a chap
willing to pay %oap gold for my
information, but for you, I think I'd agree to that price. Do we have a deal? &

Perhaps it is not so wise to mention Chrysamere so brazenly. There are few who would not kill to
gain the information I have on its wherebouts. I could guide you on your way to
recover the Sword of the Paladin, but not for less than %oap gold pieces - not an
unfair price, I think you agree. Are you prepared to pay that much? &

#0242
I knew the moment you walked in, we'd make a good deal. My information comes
from my brother, a scribe in Alabaster, a port city in Elsweyr. He does
occasional work with the archivists of the city. A rumor grew that Chrysamere,
the Sword of Heroes, had resurfaced into the known world. He delved deeper
and found that it had indeed risen again. The location was said to be
inscribed on a tablet in a place called the %amn. I have inscribed the
location of that tablet on your map of the continent. Neither
my brother or I care much for adventure. The money you have given us
will allow him to complete his studies and I to raise a family. Take care in
your quest. Both the map you seek and Chrysamere are sure to be guarded...&


#0223
Be quiet, %ra fool, the Necromancers would not think at all about killing you
just for mentioning the Staff of Magnus. Their most powerful mages are children
compared to its power, and if they could possess it, surely they would rule %cn. I
would be willing to tell you how to find the Staff, but it will cost you %oap gold in
return. Agreed?&

The Staff of Magnus? It must surely be fate that brought us two together. I am %an and I can
direct you on your way to find this most ancient and powerful of relics. Pity the
poor mage who tries to battle with you once it is in your possession, eh? All I ask
in return for my information is a pittance, %oap gold pieces. Shall we get down to
business? &

I like your arrogance, kid. Strolling into the %nt, asking about the Staff of Magnus
like it was a new brand of ale. The Necromancers of %cn have been offering me
thousands of gold pieces to tell them how to find it, but I shudder to think what
would become of %lp if they had that power. For you, I make the offer of %oap gold, a very
good price. Do we have a deal? &

#0243
Thank you for the gold. Now listen carefully. Just before the
Sorceror-King Magnus died, he trusted the only map to the location of
the Staff of Magnus to the Blades, a secret society of warriors. I
heard that one of their number sought the map that led to the Staff's current
location. He journeyed to a place called the %amn, in the Elsweyr province, but
never returned. I would never dare to go where a Bladesman met his end, but
somewhere in that dungeon is the map to the location of the Staff of Magnus.
For the money you've paid, you obviously think better of your chances. I wish
you luck in your quest. I've inscribed its location onto your map of the
continent. Good luck, %ra. I wish you well...&

#0224
Did you say 'Volendrung,' my friend? Assuming you're asking about the Dwarven Hammer
of Might, I am %an, the man you want to speak to. Perhaps you have a friend
who has met a Medusa, or an enemy who ought to. Volendrung's the hammer for you then,
kid. Just give me %oap gold to get the business end out of the way, and I'll tell you
how to find the Hammer. &

I knew the moment you walked in, you were the %ra I wanted to do business with.
You want Volendrung, the Hammer of Might: a testimony to your knowledge and good
taste. I know how you can get Volendrung. All we need is to get the little question
of price out of the way. For my assistance in getting you to the Hammer, I'm only
asking for %oap gold pieces. I assume that's fine with you? &

You must have heard I was here, offering people information for
recovering the lost Dwarven Hammer of Might. Well, you're a lucky %ra. Turns
out the folk in the %nt aren't as rich as I thought they'd be, and I need gold more than
adventure. So for %oap pieces of gold, I'll tell you exactly how to recover
Volendrung. Will you take advantage of my generosity?&

#0244
I accept your gold. I won't repeat any of this, so listen carefully.
You must journey to Hammerfell, to a place called the %amn, to find the Dwarven
Hammer of Might. In this dire place lies the secret of Volendrung's reincarnation.
Do not question how I came about this information. The price was more dear
than you can imagine. If you can survive the depths of the %amn, you will find
a map. On this map is inscribed the location of Volendrung. No thanks are
needed, nor are they appreciated. Your gold has spoken enough. One warning
will I give. Volendrung is a potent weapon, and will attract the attention
of equally potent beings. Such attention is not something I would
desire greatly...&


#0225
Who sent you? My apologies, friend. I am %an and I'm trying to avoid the agents of the Necromancers,
who want the information I have about the shield Spell Breaker. If you're interested in a
shield that would make any mage powerless against you, I can direct you for a mere
%oap gold. I need to be leaving %cn soon, so do we have a deal?&

Ah, you're looking for Spell Breaker, are you? Came to the right inn and asked the right
man, you did. They call me %an, and I can show you exactly where Spell Breaker is hidden.
A mere %oap gold and you've bought all my knowledge the shield's wherebouts. What do you think?&

Anticipating a big fight with a magus, kid? It's %an at your service. I know how
you can find out where the Spell Breaker is, but I ain't going to tell you
for free. I'd find it myself, but I'd rather have %oap gold and leave the questing to
you. What do you say, %ra? Do we have a deal?&

#0245
It seems you seek the shield, Spell Breaker, in earnest then. Well my good, %ra,
you would be one of many to find that which can negate even the most powerful
of magics. You do not need to seek far. King Rourken, last of the Dwarven Kings
had Spell Breaker fashioned for him in his war against the Wizard Shalidor.
It was lost in the final battle, and from time to time has reappeared in the
land. The clue to where it now lies seems to be in the Hammerfell province.
In my travels I stumbled upon an ancient text that speaks of a place called
the %amn. I quickly wrote down the location, then destroyed the text. I have
inscribed that location onto your map of the continent. It is there that you
will find a map to lead you to Spell Breaker. I wish you well on your quest...&


#0227
Really? You want some information
about the Necromancer's Amulet? Glad to meet you, I'm %an. I know this isn't a good
sales technique, but I've been trying to sell the information I have on its
location all day long and hardly anyone will talk to me. I think the Mages Guild in
%cn must be afraid. Well, they have caused me to lower my price. I'll tell you how to
find the most powerful magical relic in Tamriel for %oap gold. Do we have a deal?&

Glad to hear you bring it up, %ra. I'm %an and I was just beginning to assume that no one in %cn has ever
heard of Mannimarco and his Amulet. So you're in luck, %ra. My new price
for telling you exactly how to find the Amulet that will make any trickster
into an Archmage is %oap gold pieces. As they say, take it or leave it.&

You may have heard about me, %ra?
Well, at least you've heard of Mannimarco, the wizard whose Amulet you wish to possess.
You have needs and I have needs, mine being %oap gold. Being impecunious in %cn is so
tiresome, don't you know? Does this deal please you?&

#0247
Excellent, %pcn, happy to do business with you. Now then, here is what I know. I
may not look like it, but I am of noble blood, a member of one of the first
families of High Rock. For century upon century, my family has been involved
in the politics of Arena. Most of the rulers in the family have been servants
for the good of the people, but occasionally a bad egg turns up like my great
uncle. When my father took the rulership from him, he found that my uncle had
a vast storeroom of items confiscated from travelers, including a map to
the place where the Necromancer's Amulet is supposed to be now. Most of this he
returned to the rightful owners, but this map was lost in a place called the %amn.
If you go there, you should be able to find the map again, and use it to
locate the Amulet. Now I must leave you. Good luck, %ra.&

#0226
You don't look like a museum curator. You must have a practical interest in Auriel's Shield. My name is %an, if
you want to know. You probably know the story of how Cormelik made a map of
all of his expeditions to the Shield, right? Well, I know where one of his
maps is, and so can you for a mere %oap gold pieces. Do we have a deal?&

You're an ambitious %ra, ain't you? I like that.
You can call me %an. I was one of Cormelik's followers years ago, when he
was tracking all of the returning points of Auriel's Shield, and I
know where he put one of his maps. I'd go get it myself and sell it, but
then I'd be asking a lot more than %oap gold pieces. Surely you can afford that
much to recover Auriel's Shield?&

I overheard you mention Auriel's Shield, %ra. If you're serious, I should
introduce myself, %an, former follower of Cormelik the Elder, the man who prophesized
all the Shield's returning points. You've heard he was unable to enter the true place himself,
mighty a warrior as he was? So do not think it is enough to get the map I know of. In addition, I
need %oap gold to justify telling you how to find the map itself. Do we understand one another?&


#0246
Ah, I hope you know what fortune you've found today. It is in the nature of
people not to know how lucky they are. Take the case of a small group of acolytes
who journeyed across the province of High Rock. They stumbled upon a cave that
seemed to lead to deeper, darker depths. One of them read an inscription
in the entrance which indicated this place as the new resting place for a map to
Auriel's Shield. Imagine still their greater surprise when they told me,
hoping that as a follower of Cormelik the Elder, I could answer their
neophytical questions. I answered them indeed. Their blood now adornes this
city's sewers, as does their silence. I have no need of something such as
this Shield, said to be able to protect the user from any attack. You have
provided me with the money I require for arcane activities. Still, a deal
is a deal. The cave is called the %amn. Here, I have inscribed it onto your
map of the continent. Within its depths should be the map that will lead you
to Auriel's Shield. I wish you well on your journey...&


#0228
Watch your tongue, foolish %ra. Many have been murdered merely for mentioning the Blade, and, according
to some, their souls have been forever damned. If you are willing risk the odds and
become the new possessor of the Ebony Blade, I can tell you all you need to know
about recovering it. The current price for information is %oap gold. Do we have a
deal?&

I think we can help each other, young %ra.
I'm %an, and I happen to know how to find the Ebony Blade itself,
the sword that can give the wielder all the energy it sucked from its victim. Not
very pretty, but perfect for frequent combatants. You can help me by giving me %oap
gold pieces. I find myself penniless here in %cn and I'm used to living better. Are
we agreed, my friend?&

The Ebony Blade? Call me %an. I know of this sword that draws your curiousity.
Maybe you've heard that it called the Leech or the Vampire, for every time its
wielder's enemies are hurt, he grows stronger. Perhaps that's morally wrong, perhaps
not. I can tell you how to find where this wicked blade is hidden, but it will cost
you %oap gold. Do you agree to pay this?&

#0248
You seek a dire weapon indeed, %ra. The Ebony Blade sucks the very soul from
a person, transfering that lifeforce to you. I think you will be consigning
your everlasting soul to oblivion. It is your choice however. The map to the
Ebony Blade can be found in a place called the %amn. I have inscribed its location
onto your map of the continent. I wish you well on your quest. If you find
this map, it will lead you the Ebony Blade. Good luck, %ra. You'll need it...&


#0229
You want to know about the Warlock's Ring, kid? Name's %an. I can see from that
look in your eye you're interested in power. Well, the Ring has all the
defensive power of its maker, the Arch-Warlock Syrabane. Whether you can control it
or not isn't my concern. All I can do is show you how to find the Ring, and I'm
going to need %oap gold for that.&

I don't know what good it'll do you, kid. From the looks of
you, you ain't no Syrabane. It'll protect ya from certain things, but folks
are known to get a bit foolhardy with that power. Might be dangerous. Still,
I'll tell you exactly how to find it if you're interested. And because I like your
guts, I'll only ask for %oap gold. What do you think?&

You'll want to talk to me about that then, %ra. His dark eyes lose their humor. In the hands of
the Arch-Warlock Syrabane that Ring saved all Tamriel. In your hands, perhaps it
will be nothing more than a good defense against an aggressive Battlemage
or Nightblade. Still, I am in no position to chose to whom I wish to share my
information about the Ring's location. If you have %oap gold for me, all my knowledge
is yours. Agreed? &

#0249
All right, I suppose we can do business then. The secret of Syrabane is in
the province of Morrowind, in a place called the %amn. You will find a map there
to the dungeons where the Warlock's Ring is said to return by Syrabane's
post-mortal magic. I have inscribed the location of this map onto your
continental map. I hope you use the Warlock's Ring wisely. It is a
powerful aid in the reflecting of spells...&


#0230
Fancy yourself a bit of an archer? My name's %an and I think I can help you find that Bow. In
fact, I know I can, if you've got %oap gold for my information. Only fair, right?
Might sound like a lot, but you're getting exclusive knowledge about the wherebouts
of one of the greatest lost artifacts of Tamriel. So we have an agreement, %ra?&

Someone must've told you I'd be here, he says, his voice slurred with drink. Everyone in
%lp knows if you want to find Auriel's Bow, %an's
the man you should talk to, and that's me. Maybe if someone else knew what I do, he'd
try and get the bow himself or make himself rich, but, you know, my
needs are modest. Everything I know about finding the bow can be bought for %oap gold
pieces. Interested?&

Good day to you. I'm %an, at your service. I'm the fellow you should speak with if you're interested in Auriel's
Bow. In the hands of an accomplished archer, as you no doubt are, the Bow could very
well be the deadliest weapon in Tamriel. Perfect, don't you think?
Anyhow, all I ask is %oap gold to show you exactly how the bow may be yours. Sound
good to you? &

#0250
Yeah, okay, that works for me. So listen up, %pcf. You might've heard tales
about Auriel's Bow, famed by all archers as the most powerful bow to ever
exist. You're going to have to voyage to Valenwood, and find the map that leads
to this Elven artifact. I have gleaned the information on its whereabouts
from an ancient text given to me by the Elven Lord Alendis. The place is
called the %amn, and I will inscribe it onto your map of the continent. If you
can find the map, it should point out where Auriel's Bow has resurfaced...&


#0231
What kind of %ra are you? You a thief or just
thinking about becoming one? Doesn't matter to me anyhow. The Skeleton's Key is
not easy to find, mate, but the right person with the right information will be
able to do it. I don't know if you're good enough for it, but I can sell you
the right information for %oap gold. What do you say?&

Name's %an, %ra. No one wants the Skeleton's Key to be found, except maybe
a few loner thieves. Nothing would be safe from the clutches of the
person who holds the key, you understand. I don't care, myself. All I need is %oap
gold to tell you exactly how to get the key yourself. &

I make it my business to know where things are. I can tell you how to get the Skeleton's
Key yourself. I won't ask why you wish to have the power to open any lock or portal
you're probably no more nosy and covetous than I. In this case, I'll only
ask for %oap gold for the information that will lead to the the Skeleton Key.
You have that much money to spare, eh?&

#0251
Ah, yes, my purse likes the sound of that. You'll find the Skeleton's Key in a
particularly unpleasant dungeon. Of course, no one except a few know where it
is, for the Key always chooses inaccessible places to hide. For benefit of
the historians, the first holder of the Key, Arrovan, made a map to each
of the Key's resting places, but for many years no one could find this one.
My contacts say the map is in a place called the %amn. I have inscribed the
location onto your map of the continent. I must leave you. Good luck, my %ra
friend...&


#0232
Today's your lucky day, %ra. I'm %an, and not only can I tell you
whatever you want to know about the Ring of Phynaster, I can show you just how you
can find it. All I'm asking for this wealth of information is %oap gold. A pretty
modest sum considering that soon you'll have nothing to fear from magic,
or poison. Are you willing?&

Good to meet you, %pcf. I
go by the name of %an, and I'm just the man you want to speak to if you want to find
the lost Ring of Phynaster. It's not lost at all, you see. There's a
map that... well, why spoil the surprise? For a mere %oap gold pieces, I'll finish
my last sentence. Is it a deal?&

There was a time when I'd be suspicious of a young %ra wandering in to the %nt and
asking about the commodity I'm selling.
The Wharf Rats would rather have me dead than divulging the secret location of
the Ring of Phynaster. I can help you, if you're willing to part with %oap of your
hard-earned gold pieces. Before responding, just think of how much more you can earn
after the Ring has made you invulnerable to nearly anything a mage or a thief
can throw at you. Do we have a deal?&

#0252
Very good, for now we can do business. You know that Phynaster was killed by the
Wharf Rats for his Ring? It's true. He was buried somewhere in the Forest of Elborn
and the Ring has ever since been stored in one of their hundreds of underground
headquarters. Even should the Ring be taken by thieves, a charm has been cast on
it so it will eventually return to one of the Rats' sanctuaries. The faction of the
Rats decided that the best place to hide the map to the Ring's most recent
resting place was in the a place called the %amn, in the Summurset Isle. I will
inscribe the location onto your map of the continent. If you can find the map,
it will lead you to the Ring of Phynaster...&


#0233
Well, I won't ask you how you knew who to question about King Orgnum's Coffer. 
Someone on the street
must have told you where %an was conducting his business. He or she probably doubted
my authenticity, given the suspicious nature of the %cn citizenry. I assure you that
if you follow my advice, you will be a very rich %ra. All I ask is %oap gold - a
small advance on your forthcoming salary.&

Of course, everyone wants to know if King Orgnum's Coffer is a fact or a
myth. But if they knew the Coffer existed and where it is, how many would be brave
enough to go after them? Most people wish for a magic box always full of money, but
are too lazy or frightened to follow their dream. My name is %an and if you have the
will and %oap gold pieces, I will tell you how to find King Orgnum's Coffer.&

I am %an. I know how you may find King Orgnum's Coffer and
I will tell you, for a price, of course. %oap gold pieces, to be exact. This may seem
like a lot of money, but with the Coffer, you will have a daily income most people in
%cn dream of making annually. I think the price is fair. Your reply, %ra?&

#0253
Thank you very much, %ra. The gold will come in handy. I hope you can make
equally good use of my information. King Orgnum lost his Coffer eighty or
more years ago, during one of the marine battles with the Emperor of Tamriel,
who was then Antiochus Septim. After the loss, Orgnum's island kingdom of
Pyandonea ceased to be a world power - probably because the King could no
longer afford as great a fleet as before. The Coffer washed ashore on
Summurset Isle, where it was an elusive presence. If I were you, I'd go to
a place called the %amn, and see if you can find the map that leads to the
Coffer. I'll inscribe its location onto your map of the continent.
I wish you good luck.&


#0234
Good news travels fast, eh, %ra? I was wondering how long it would take before every
adventurer in %lp showed up to beg me to tell them the location of the Ebony Mail. Who
wouldn't want to wear armor that makes you gives you such power, power no
spell can take away from you? Well, you can bet I'm not going to divulge my secret
for free. My current price is %oap gold pieces. Take it or leave it.&

You're not the first person to
come here asking about the Ebony Mail, he says. Lots of people like the idea of
getting a legendary item that gives them such power, but few have even almost the
%oap gold pieces I need to tell the secret location. Do you have it?&

You can call me %an, %ra. I'm the one who knows how to find
the Ebony Mail, the lost armor of the Drow that could make even you a hero.
Right now, I'm asking for %oap gold for my information - a preposterously low
price, but still more than most people in the %nt are able to pay, it seems.&

#0254
Exactly what I hoped you'd say. The bad news is you'll have to go to Black
Marsh to find the Mail, to a nasty little place called the %amn. There lies the
map to the spirit-forsaken dungeon holding the Ebony Mail. You'll find
that the map points out the place where the Dark Elven goddess Boethiah
hid the Mail after she took it from a warrior she no
longer favored. Rather like Kynareth and Morihaus, but that's another story.
I will inscribe the location of the %amn onto your map of the continent.
The map that will lead you to the Ebony Mail lies there. I doubt if Boethiah
even cares after all this time, but I'll wish you luck anyhow. Goodbye.&


#0235
So, you've heard of the Ring, have you, %ra? Well, let me tell you all the legends about
Rajhin and his Ring of the Khajiit are absolutely true. There does exist such a Ring
that endows its wearer with many powers, including invisibility, and there is even a map to
its recent hiding place! I am %an, one of the few who know of its location.
Regretfully, I must sell the knowledge I have, but it won't be
cheap. %oap gold pieces is the minimum price I'll accept.&

Another hero like Rajhin in training, eh? Hoping to use the power of the Ring of the Khajiit
to rob the citizens of %cn or take advantage of opponents, perhaps? Good
for you, %ra. I am %an of %cn2 and I can show you how you may
find the Ring and win the power of invisibility. I will require %oap gold of you to
prove your seriousness in this matter. How does that sound to you?&

Do you even know what the Ring of the Khajiit is, %ra? You know it turns the wearer invisible, but are you aware of
the responsibility and power given to the Ring bearer? There was a time when I would
sooner die that give up the secret given to me by the spirit of Rajhin himself. %an
is not without honor. I will require no less than %oap gold pieces to betray my
friend and divulge the location.&

#0255
Well, yeah, I suppose we can do business on that. You might've guessed,
but I knew Rajhin myself. He was my friend. For months after he disappeared,
I spoke to a spiritualist, attempting to ascertain his condition. It all came
to naught, until a few weeks ago, when his spirit appeared before me.
He told me he was bound to appear and tell of the Ring of Khajiit, as long as it
was missing from the land. I know it lies in a dank abyss where it had
been hidden by the Underking. He also told me that a map exists to that
crypt. The map is in the %amn, somewhere in Black Marsh. I will inscribe
its location onto your map of the continent. Fare thee well, %ra.&


#0236
What a disappointment. Goodbye then. I'll be at the %nt for %dit more days if
you change your mind.&

I've wasted enough time already. You can find me here for
%dit days if you get the money or change your mind. Leave me now.&

I understand your monetary situation. If it changes, I'm staying here %dit days
more. Please excuse me, %ra.&

No hard feelings, but I'll look for other interested parties. I'll be here %dit
days if you want to think about it and get back to me. Until then, goodbye.&

You don't know what you're passing up. Well, I must be leaving %cn in %dit days, but
you'll find me here until then if you come to your senses. Goodbye.&

I was prepared for reasonable haggling. I must say I'm disappointed. Come back
within %dit days if you're willing to negotiate. Goodbye.&

An offer like this comes once in a lifetime. You'll be sorry. I'll give you %dit
days to get back to me here before I move on. Excuse me now.&

Sorry we couldn't help one another, %ra. I'm staying here at the %nt for %dit more days,
so if there's a change in your courage or your purse size, look me up. Goodbye.&

You don't even know what an excellent price I was offering. Ah well, I'll be here
for %dit more days if you change your mind. Pardon me now.&

Oh well. I'll probably still be at the %nt for %dit days with my offer standing. Fare
thee well, young %ra.&

I hope you never know the power you passed up today. If you're smart, you'll
be back with gold in hand before %dit days pass and I leave %cn. Take care of yourself.&

Fine. Please excuse me while I look for truly adventurous parties. The offer and I
will be here for %dit days and then we're leaving fair %cn. Free advice: come back
with gold.&

Price a little too hefty for you, %ra? I understand. Listen, I'll be here for %dit
days yet. Come back with the gold I require. Don't wait too long. Now I must
go.&

Well, you'll probably find me here for %dit days or so, provided the %cn locals
don't drive me out of the %ct. Come back if you change your mind.&

I knew I was wasting my time talking to you. If you can get back to the %nt within %dit
days with my gold, we can still do business. Meanwhile, I must leave you. Farewell.&

#0237
Good to see you again, %pcf. You've come to buy the information I have about %art,
eh? I think I told you I'd let you know everything for %nap gold pieces, right?&
If it isn't the old %ra, back in the %nt already, %an appears at your side, rising from a side
tavern table. Guess you changed your mind. I haven't changed mine about %art. If you
want to know how to get it, you better have %nap gold pieces. Final offer.&

Back again? Well, the offer still stands,
lucky for you. I will tell you everything I know about the location of %art for %nap
gold pieces. No credit, naturally.&

I knew you'd be back. I assume you're now prepared to give me %nap gold pieces to learn
how one may find %art of legend?&

You've reconsidered, he says. Marvelous. Now if you
have the %nap pieces of gold I requested, I'll tell you exactly how one might find
%art. Agreed?&

Hello again, %pcf. Good to see it didn't take you long to
change your mind about %art. I assume you're ready to pay the %nap gold I mentioned
before?&

I wasn't sure I'd see you again, %ra. I haven't had any other takers yet, but my offer
for showing you the way to %art stands at %nap gold. Are you prepared to pay that much?&

Good to see you, %ra. I haven't had any luck yet. Seems anyone who believes %art
exists doesn't have the gold to pay for my information. Are you ready to pay the %nap gold?&

Oh, it's you again. Listen, I was just talking to someone else who seems interested, so
if you don't have the %nap gold we discussed last time, don't waste my time.&

Good to see you again, %pcn. I was just talking to a few interested persons
about %art. If you have the %nap gold pieces we talked about before, I'd be happy to
deal with you instead.&

#0238
Well, no. I can't accept any less than %nap gold.&

A little backbone I like, %ra. Would you consider %nap gold instead?&

Sorry, I can't justify that. %nap gold seems fair. What do you think?&

You're a good haggler, %ra. I'm afraid I can't accept less than %nap gold.&

That's a fair offer, but %nap gold pieces is an even more fair offer.&

Are you certain you can't make it %nap gold? I'd agree to that.&

I'd like to, but I can't accept that. Would you agree to %nap gold?&

Interesting offer, but %nap gold is the least I can accept in return for my
information. Come now, %ra, what do you think of that?&

I can't accept that, I'm afraid. I'd take %nap gold, though.&

I understand your position, trying to get the best price you can. Let's say %nap
gold, shall we?&

Sorry, I've already turned someone down who offered that. What's your reaction to
%nap gold pieces?&

No, no, no. Let's try again. I'll tell you everything I know for %nap gold.&

#0239
Forget it, pal. You're going to have to do a lot better than that.&

I haven't insulted your intelligence yet, please don't insult mine. Make a
legitimate offer.&

If that's the best you can offer, just say goodbye. Otherwise, you're going to have
to make it more, %ra.&

Not even close. If that's all you have, don't waste my time.&

I assume that was a joke. Please make me a legitimate offer.&

I like to think I have a good sense of humor, but you're wasting my time. Either say
goodbye or make a real offer.&

Please don't insult me with pitiful offers. Tell me what you'll really pay for the information.&

There's a fine line between shrewd bartering and outright insults, and you've crossed it.
Make a legitimate offer this time.&

That's what I paid for your mother last night, but I want a lot more for something
worthwhile. Don't insult me again.&

Ha. Make me a less amusing offer or stop wasting my time.&

I can understand bargain shopping, but you're being ridiculous. I'm going
to need a lot more than that.&

Not a chance, pal. Try again.&

Yeah, I don't think so. Make me a real offer.&

Not even close. Is that the best you can offer?&

That, %ra, was an insulting offer. You know my information is worth more than that.&

Listen, we're talking about one of the original great artifacts of Tamriel. You
offer me a reasonable price, now.&


#0257
Welcome to our small and humble village of %cn.
Please feel free to visit our leader, %t %rf anytime.
We hope you enjoy your stay.&

You are welcome in the small %lp village of %cn, traveler.
Visit our noble ruler, %t %rf, always at your service.
We advise against walking the streets unarmed at night.&

%t %rf entreats you to rest, gentle traveler, in the arms of %cn, one of the
smallest villages in all %lp. The %t welcomes visitors in %g3 audience chamber at
the palace during daylight hours. No appointment is necessary.&

#0258
We don't care who you're running from here in the town of %cn. Get in %t %rf's way
and we'll gut you like a pig. Have a fun time.&

There is no finer town in %lp than %cn, ruled by the merciful %t %rf. We welcome
travelers, but panderers, derelicts, and adventurers are advised not to enter. The
%t welcomes all to %g3 palace audience chamber from mid morning until early
evening.&

%rf, %t of %cn welcomes all to this town, whether your visit is inspired by
business or pleasure. Most taverns and inns are open to all humanoids, and the %t is
available at %g3 palace all day long. Enjoy your stay.&

#0259
I have no idea where that is. Sorry.&

You're asking the wrong person. Try someone else.&

I wish I could help you, but I haven't any idea.&

Sorry, %ra. I'm afraid I don't know where that is.&

Sorry, I wish I could help you. You should ask someone else.&

I'm certain someone else could give directions, but not I.&

Wish I could help you, %ra. You ought to ask someone else.&

I thought I knew %cn pretty well, but I have no idea where that is.&

#0260
Oh, you'll find that %di of here.&

Now, I might be wrong but I'd look %di of here.&

I'm pretty sure it's %di of here...&

That's a bit %di of here, I'm sure of it.&

I would check to the %di if I were you.&

I'm not really sure. Go %di for a while and ask there.&

That's easy - it's %di of here.&

That's %di of here, last time I checked.&

#0261
Without hesitation %n asks for your map to inscribe the exact location.&

It'd be easy if I just showed you, %n says and inscribes the precise location on your map.&

Let me see your map, %n says. It's so nearby, it's easier just to show you.&

Why don't I just inscribe the exact location on your map? %n says, pulling out a feather pen.&

If I could see your map, I'll show you just how close you are. %n takes a pen from %g3 pocket.&

It's very near, %n says, reaching for your map. Let me show you how close you are.&

Here, give me your map, %n says. I'll show you how close you are.&

Give me just a moment and I'll show right on your map how close you are,
%n says.&

You have found the map that leads to %art, somewhere in the
province of %apr. You inscribe the location onto your map of
the continent...&

#0501
You have uncovered the legendary %art, lost for ages. With reverence you
add the item to your inventory...&

#0502
The map to the %art lies in the %amn, somewhere in the province of %mpr...&

#0503
The legendary %art lies in the %adn, somewhere in the province of %apr...&

#0504
There is a sudden, blinding flash and your %arc vanishes from your sight.&

You can hear a low hum coming from your %arc, and suddenly, it fades away.&

A glowing aura suddenly envelopes your %arc, and when it fades away, the
%arc is gone.&

#0505
The Lord's Mail, sometimes called the Armor of Morihaus, the Gift of
Kynareth, is an ancient cuirass of unsurpassable quality. It grants the
wearer the power to regenerate lost health, resist the effects of spells, and cure
oneself of poison when used. It is said that whenever Kynareth deigns the
wearer unworthy, the Lord's Mail will be taken away and hidden for the next
chosen one.&

#0506
The Oghma Infinium is a tome of knowledge written by the Ageless One, the
wizard-sage Xarses. All who read the Infinium are filled with the energy of
the artifact which can be manipulated to raise one's abilities to near
demi-god proportions. Once used, legend has it, the Infinium will disappear
from its wielder.&

#0507
Chrysamere, the Paladin's Blade and Sword of Heroes, is an ancient claymore
with offensive capabilities only surpassed by its defenses. It lends the
wielder health, protects him or her from fire, and reflects any deletory
spells cast against the wielder back to the caster. Seldom has Chrysamere
been wielded by any bladesman for any length of time, for it chooses not
to favor one champion.&

#0508
The Staff of Magnus, one of the elder artifacts of Tamriel, was a
metaphysical battery of sorts for its creator, the Arch-Mage Magnus. When
used, it regenerates both a mage's health and mystical energy at remarkable
rates. In time, the Staff will abandon the mage who wields it before he or
she becomes too powerful and upsets the mystical balance it is sworn to
protect.&

#0509
The Hammer of Might, Volendrung is said to have been created by the Dwarves
of the now abandoned clan of Rourken, hundreds of years before they
disappeared from the world of Tamriel. It has the ability to grant health
to its wielder, but it is best known for the paralyzing and strength
leeching effects it has when cast at an enemy. Like the Dwarves who created
it, Volendrung is prone to disappearing suddenly, resurfacing sometimes in
days, sometimes in eons.&

#0510
Spell Breaker, superficially a Dwarven tower shield, is one of the most
prized ancient relics of Tamriel. Aside from its historic importance dating
from the Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, the Spell Breaker protects its wielder
almost completely from any spellcaster, either by dispelling magicks or
silencing any mage about to cast a spell. It is said that the Spell Breaker
still searches for its original owner, and will not remain the property of
any one else for long. For most, possessing Spell Breaker for any time
is power enough.&

#0511
The legendary Necromancer's Amulet, the last surviving relic of the mad
sorceror Mannimarco, grants any spellcaster who wears it the ability to
absorb magical energy and regenerate from injury. The Amulet is
mystically fortified to give the person wearing it an armor rating equivalent
to plate armor, without the weight and restriction of movement. This makes the
artifact popular amongst thieves and mages alike. It is the one flaw of the
Amulet that it is unstable in this world - forever doomed to fade in and out
of existence, reappearing at locations distant from that of its disappearance.&

Auriel's Shield, an Ebony shield said to have once belonged to the
quasi-mythical Elvish deity Auriel, can make its wielder nigh
invulnerable. In its resistance to fire and magick, Auriel's Shield is
unsurpassed. To defend its wielder from any attacks it cannot absorb, the
Shield lends him or her health. Like many artifacts of Tamriel, the Shield
has life and personality of its own, and does not feel bound to its user.
A popular fable tells the tale of it abandoning one wielder in her greatest
hour of need, but this is perhaps, apocryphal.&

#0513
The Ebony Blade, sometimes called the Vampire or the Leech, resembles an
ebony katana, but its power is very dark indeed. Every time the Ebony Blade
strikes an opponent, part of the damage inflicted flows into the wielder
as raw power. The Blade itself may not be any more evil than those who have
used it, but at some point in its long existence, a charm was cast on it so
it would not remain with one bladesman. The wizard who cast this charm
sought to save the souls of any too infatuated by the Blade, and perhaps
he was right...&

#0514
The Warlock's Ring of the Arch-Mage Syrabane is one of the most popular
relics of myth and fable. In Tamriel's ancient history, Syrabane saved all
of the continent by judicious use of his Ring, and ever since, it has helped
adventurers with less lofty goals. It is best known for its ability to
reflect spells cast at its wearer and to improve his or her speed and
health, though it may have additional powers. No adventurer can wear
the Warlock's Ring for long, for it is said the Ring is Syrabane's alone to
command.&

#0515
Auriel's Bow appears as a modest Elven Longbow, but it one of the mightiest
weapons ever to exist in Tamriel's history. Allegedly created and used,
like its sister Auriel's Shield, by the great Elvish demi-god, the Bow can
turn any arrow into a missile of death and any wielder invulnerable to any
lesser attacks. Without Auriel's power behind it, however, the bow uses its
own store of energy for its power. Once exhausted of this energy, the bow
will vanish and reappear where ever chance puts it. Its most recent
appearances have been subject of gossip for hundreds of years.&

#0516
The power of the Skeleton's Key is very simple, indeed. With it, any
non-magically locked door or chest is instantly accessible to even the
clumsiest of lockpickers. A particularly skillful lockpicker may even open
some magically barred doors with the Key. The two limitations placed on the
Key by wizards who sought to protect their storehouses were that the Key
could only be used once a day and it would never be the property of one
thief for too long. Some of those who have possessed the Key have made
themselves rich before it disappeared, others have broken into places they
never should have entered ...&

#0517
The Ring of Phynaster was made hundreds of years ago by a person who needed
good defenses to survive his adventurous life. Thanks to the Ring,
Phynaster lived for hundreds of years, and since then it has passed from
person to person. The ring improves its wearer's overall resistance to
damage and grants total immunity to poison, spells, and electricity. Still,
Phynaster was cunning and said to have cursed the Ring. It eventually
disappears from its holder's possessions and returns to another resting
place, uncontent to stay anywhere but with Phynaster himself.&

#0518
King Orghum's Coffer is a small-sized chest, ordinary in appearance. It is
remarkably light, almost weightless, which offers clue to its true magic.
Once a day, the Coffer will create gold from naught. When King Orghum
himself possessed the Coffer, the supply within was limitless. Those who
have found it since report that the Coffer eventually disappears after
having dispersed enough gold to shame even the wealthiest of merchants.
Where and why it vanishes is still a mystery.&

#0519
The Ebony Mail is an artifact created before recorded history, according to
legend, by the Dark Elven goddess Boethiah. It is she who determines who
should possess the Mail and for how long a time. If judged worthy,
its power grants the wearer invulnerability to all common magical attacks that
drain talents and health. It is Boethiah alone who determines when a person
is ineligible to bear the Ebony Mail any longer, and the goddess can be
very capricious...&

#0520
The Ring of the Khajiiti is an ancient relic, hundreds of years older than
Rajhin, the thief who made the Ring famous. It was Rajhin who used the
Ring's powers to make himself as invisible, silent, and quick as a breath
of wind. Using the Ring he became the most successful burglar in Elsweyr's
history. Rajhin's eventual fate is a mystery, but according to
legend, the Ring rebelled against such constant use and disappeared,
leaving Rajhin helpless before his enemies...&

in all its fiery glory...

northern region of Valenwood. To the

forest than a thriving metropolis...

lying lightly upon our shoulders...
&

#0656
Stormhold lies on the northern tip of the
Province of Black Marsh. Here the

in their eyes. Perhaps it is because of
their proximity to the Dark Elven lands...
&

#0657

the Jewel of the East. Vagabonds eye your purse
strings and guards seem to turn lazy eyes
elsewhere...
&

#0658
You enter the city gates of Helstrom,
noticing the dark looks the guards give
you. They have a reputation of
being very dangerous. Perhaps you can
change that...
&

#0659
Gideon, the black city of the followers of

Imperial Run. A cold air that has nothing
to do with the time of year seems to chill
your bones as you enter...
&

#0660

behind, you enter Soulrest. Inside it seems
as if a hush as fallen over the city, as

eyes on your back as the city gates shut
behind you with a hollow boom...
&

#0662
Lilmoth seems gloomy and forbidding. Never before
have you experienced the unnatural fear
that pervades the atmosphere. This city it
is rumored, holds much under its
streets...
&

#0663
The city gate of Archon looms over you
as you enter. People around you here
seem to be avoiding eye contact...
&


#0664
You enter the Imperial City, the heart of Tamriel, and the seat of
power for his majesty, the Emperor Uriel Septim VII.&


#1274
Your inventory feels somewhat lighter. Apparently, some kind
pickpocket has relieved you of some of your burden.&

Reflecting on the %omq's value now that it is too late to
complete the delivery, you toss it into the grass.&

The %omq has no value to anyone but the person for whom you were
delivering it. As it is too late to complete the quest, you toss it
away.&

#1275
It is too late to get the %omq to the only place where it is
worth something. You toss it into the nearest bush.&

An uneasy feeling comes over you. You suspect something has
been taken from you by some nimble-fingered thief.&

As Late as it is, you are not going to get one gold piece for
the %omq now. In the interest of traveling light, you toss it
into the grass.&

#1276
%ne says, Listen, I know my way from here. Thanks for your
help, %pcf. %g hurries away.&

Sorry, %ne says, hurrying off, But at this rate, I'll
never make it. I'll just find my way myself.&

I don't even know why I needed an escort in the first place. %ne waves goodbye and leaves, figuring
%g can find %g3 own way.&

#1277
You have agreed to deliver a %omq to %tl by %da.&

#1278
You have agreed to get a %omq from %tl and bring it back to
the %nt by %da.&

#1279
You have agreed to stand guard and protect %fq's property
from an attack by %o.&

#1280
You have agreed to escort %fq's %r, %ne, to %tl by %da.&

#1281
Welcome to our small, and humble %ct of %cn. Please feel free to visit our
leader, %t %rf anytime. We hope you enjoy your stay.&

#1282
We don't care who you're running from here in the %ct of %cn. Get in
%t %rf's way and we'll gut you like a pig. Have a fun time.&

#1283
This is the City-State of %cn. %t %rf doesn't care what you do,
as long as you don't get caught. We don't have time to give all
offenders a trial, we just execute them.&

#1284
The Imperial City, the heart of the empire, welcomes you. The %t %rf asks you to feel free to
look about and enjoy yourselves. We are at your disposal.&

#1286
The rumors of the Underking's interest in your activities seem to be correct.
His forces are known for their fanaticism in battle.&

The %opp obviously belongs to the ranks of the Underking's minions. There is a sheen
of madness in the eyes that tells you negotiation is futile.&

There are those who doubt the existence of the Underking, but something about the
behavior of this %opp makes you an instant believer.&

Your path is barred by a %opp, obviously one of the Underking's minions.
It looks as if no uniform is needed to declare allegiance to the
Evil One.&

It is said that those who associate with the Underking risk their sanity itself. The
%opp before you proves this wisdom.&


#1287
The %opp who approaches, you notice, has been branded with a small black
pentagram, the symbol of the Necromancers.&

The Necromancers always brand their minions with a black pentagram as symbol of their
souls' damnation. The %opp before you has such a brand.&

All members and servants of the Necromancers are branded with a black pentagram. The
%opp barring your path displays one with pride.&

The black pentagram you see branded on the %opp approaching alerts you.
Doubtless a servant of the Necromancers, sent to stop your
journey cold.&

You know what the black pentagram branded on the %opp means. The rumors were right -
the Necromancers want you stopped.&

#1288
The %opp before you bears the colors of the Mages' Guild proudly. The
intention is obvious - your quest is not to be completed.&

There is nothing accidental about meeting with this %opp, wearing the colors
of the Mages' Guild and intent on disrupting your quest.&

It is said that the Mages' Guild is a beneficent organization, but deadly when
crossed. One look in the %opp's eyes and you see the truth in the saying.&

The rumors of the Mages' Guild's hostility toward your activities seem to be true.
The %opp bears the traditional colors of the Guild.&

You no longer doubt the involvement of the Mages' Guild in this quest. Obviously, the
%opp was sent by them to stop you at all costs.&


#1289
If this %opp is truly an agent of the Blades, you know you will be facing a worthy
adversary indeed...&

The %opp barring your path is obviously an agent of the Blades and no mercenary, for
there is a tell-tale scar over the %opp's right eye.&

This is no ordinary %opp, you see from the start. You notice a scar above
the %opp's right eye, the symbol of the Blades.&

You know this is no chance meeting with a hostile %opp. There is a scar over
the %opp's right eye proclaiming alignment with the Blades.&

The scar over the right eye and the general demeanor tells you this %opp is a member
of the Blades, trained in the art of battle ...&


#1290
The %opp is one of the traditional emissaries of the Dark Brotherhood. You know
the orders are to kill you swiftly ...&

Crossing the Dark Brotherhood is sheer idiocy, and one look at the %opp and you know
that is exactly what you have done.&

The loyalty of the servants of the Dark Brotherhood is legendary. You know the %opp
will never yield or grant mercy to foes.&

Immediately you know the Dark Brotherhood sent this %opp to kill you. Something in
the eyes, something merciless ...&

There can be no doubt the Dark Brotherhood sent the %opp after you. The servants of
the Dark Brotherhood are legion.&

#1291
The Wharf Rats are not known for their subtlety. You can guess what this
%opp wants - your head to bring to the masters.&

You can tell at a glance the %opp in your path is no random nuisance.
You recognize one of the Wharf Rats sent to rip you apart.&

Despite the %opp's scruffy appearance, a worthy opponent. The Wharf Rats
truly are interested in your activities it seems.&

The %opp before you is a member of the Wharf Rats, no doubt about it.
The general dirtiness and rancid breath immediately tip you off.&

#1292
Members of the Thieves' Guild wear no club colors, for theirs is a secret
society. Only a true idiot would doubt the masters of this %opp anyhow.&

You are attacked by a %opp, obviously sent from the Thieves' Guild. Negotiation is
not the %opp's style: it appears there are other plans for you...&

The rumors of the Thieves' Guild's interest in your job are apparently true. The %opp
before you obviously is not under orders to take prisoners.&

The %opp before you was sent by the Thieves' Guild. There is no announcement of
intentions... allegiance to the Thieves' Guild shines in the eyes.&

Recognizing consorts of the Thieves' Guild is a lesson taught to most young children
of Tamriel. The %opp before you belongs to that order.&

#1293
This %opp was obviously sent by %o to stop you, for %g3 family colors
are borne by the %opp with pride.&

The %opp blocking your path is at the service of another. %o seems the
obvious master, if %g truly wishes for your quest to fail.&

The colors borne by the hostile %opp are those of %o. It would seem the rumors of %g3
interest in aborting your quest are true.&

The occasional wandering %opp is not an unusual sight, but one bearing
the colors of %o is strange indeed. It is evident that %g really must
want you dead.&

You might assume this to be a chance encounter with a hostile %opp, but not
one carrying the colors of %o. The rumors of %g3 involvement in your quest are apparently true.&


#1500
I see you have strengthened your arm, and
your mind, %pcf. It is time we began this
journey. This is the Staff of Chaos,
the one item that can open the door between
this world, and the dimension to which the
Emperor has been banished. Tharn used this
item to destroy my corporeal form when I tried
to warn the Council. He knew that the Staff of
Chaos was nigh indestructable, having been made
from the essence of the Land itself. But in that
he found the key. As the land is split, so did
he shatter the Staff into eight perfectly formed
pieces. These he scattered across the realm. I
have been able to divine the location of the
first piece, a place called Fang Lair.&


#1294
It is said that Fang Lair was originally built
by the Dwarves of Kragen. Legend has it
that a Great Wyrm drove the Dwarves from
their home in the Dragon's Teeth, and took
the Lair for itself. I only wish I knew the
exact location. Perhaps there are sages, or
scholars who would know of this place.
Somewhere in its dank depths lies the first
piece of the Staff of Chaos. I wish you
well, %pcn. I do not think Tharn knows of
your escape, but I can do little else in this form.
I have tried to obscure your identity with a
spell, but I do not know how well it will hide
you. Take care for Tharn may be searching.
Go forth with the blessings of the true Emperor,
and myself...&


#1295
It seems that you are well chosen, %pcf. I
see that you have won the first piece of the
Staff. That in and of itself is not a simple
task. Tharn it seems, is not as concerned
with you as I had thought he would be.
Perhaps he thinks you dead or lost in the sewers
from which you escaped. That is	well, for I have
discovered the second piece's location.
There was once a great maze, built by the
Archmagus Shalidor to guard what he
called, Glamorill, the elven term for 'The
Secret of Life'. I know not the location of
the great maze, which was called the
Labyrinthian, but somewhere in its twisted
corridors lies the second piece of the Staff
of Chaos. Shalidor, according to the old
texts, made his home in the Fortress of Ice.
He would not have built the Labyrinthian
far from his home. I would search to the
north for such a place. I wish you well on
your journey...&


#1296
I would congratulate you on retrieving the
second piece of the Staff of Chaos, %pcf,
but dire portents have I seen. The third
piece of the Staff lies somewhere in the
Elden Grove, ancient home of the Elves.
The Elden Grove is said to be the
birthplace of the sacred First Tree, that
which gave life to all the forests on the
continent of Tamriel. Its location has been
a closely guarded secret, so guarded in fact
that many believe that even the Elves have
forgotten its true location. Considering that
there are only three provinces that hold any
of the Elven people, your search should not
be too difficult. Find the Elden Grove and
recover the third piece of the Staff. I wish
you well on your quest...&


#1297
You have done well, %pcf. I had thought
you lost to me. The third piece of the Staff is
yours. Rumors have been whispered about in
the Empire. I think Tharn senses that the
pieces come together. You must take care to
not be discovered by him. Your death would
be most unpleasant.
I have divined the location of the fourth
piece of the Staff. It lies in the Halls of
Colossus, a structure built to honor a race of
Giants, though none have been seen in the
land for ages. It is said that the Halls of
Colossus sat perched on a cliff overlooking
the Great Divide, which is along the southern
edge of Tamriel. Perhaps the Halls are near
that coastline. I only wish I could offer you
more. Fare thee well my friend, and find this
place, for the sake of our loved ones...&


#1298
You have recovered the fourth piece! I
honor your bravery, %pcf. Listen closely
now my friend, for Tharn has begun in
earnest to look for you. Do not fear, he does
not know your true identity, but he can sense
the Staff's power. With four of the eight
pieces, you stand out like a lantern at night. I
urge you to caution. The fifth piece of the
Staff lies in an ancient stronghold of sorcery
called the Crystal Tower. It was said that the
southern tip of the Dragon's Teeth, which stretches
from the ice covered mounts of High Rock to the wooded
forests of Valenwood, could be
seen on the horizon from the top parapet of
the Tower. This would lead me to believe it
is not far south of the majestic mountain range.
You must find the Tower and gain access to
recover the fifth piece of the Staff of Chaos...&


#1299
It has become a habit, congratulating you on
your success. Still, there are three pieces left,
and what guards them only the Divine Lady
may know. I have spent many a day
searching the ethereal planes for some clue
as the location of the sixth piece of the Staff.
This is what I have found. The piece was
sent to a place called the Crypt of Hearts. I
have no clue as to the location of such a
place. The price for the little knowledge I
have was... exacting. Still, only three
provinces remain that can hold these last
pieces. It can only lie in one of these. Good
luck, %pcf...&


#1300
Tharn is livid, scattering about the Imperial
Palace like a rabid dog. You have caused
him no end of worry. I am sure the Wizard's
minions are tracking you. I will say no more,
lest I tempt Fate. You seek now the seventh
piece of the Staff of Chaos. I have found that
this piece lies in a place called Murkwood,
the dark forest that ever moves. There can
only be one of two provinces left that can
hold this forest, Black Marsh or Morrowind.
I would start my search in one of these...&


#1301
I would take no chances, %pcf, for Tharn has no
mercy and will attack the moment he
perceives the Staff reassembled. You must
be swift. To the northeast lies the fire
mountain, Dagoth-Ur. Somewhere in its
volcanic depths is the final piece of the Staff
of Chaos. The entrance to that fabled
mountain has disappeared with the Dwarves
that mined it. There may still be those who
know of it, however. Find the entrance, enter
the volcanic catacombs, and return with the
final piece of the Staff. We are so close, I
wish you well...&


#1302
I had expected that with all eight pieces together,
the Staff of Chaos would activate and free
the Emperor. None of this has occurred, and
I finally know why.
Held by Tharn is a gem of the rarest
qualities. Legend has that it is a star fallen
from the sky, for it glows with an inner
flame. This is the Jewel of Fire, and the
crucible of Tharn's life force. It is also the
thing in which Tharn has suffused all of the
energy of the Staff. If you can touch the
Staff to this Jewel, the release of that
combined energy may be enough to destroy
the Staff of Chaos and open the gate
between worlds. If you are successful, Tharn
will no doubt be destroyed as well.
There is only one way to get this Jewel.
You must make your way into the Imperial
Palace and find wherever Tharn has hidden
it. Be warned, once inside Tharn will throw
the full might of the Palace Guards and
those creatures made to resemble the
Imperial Guard against you. They are but
puppets of Tharn's machinations. Have
mercy on them, for they know not what they
serve. With Tharn however, such care need
not be taken. If you are successful a
dimensional door should open, freeing the
Emperor. With the Jewel drained of energy
Tharn should also perish.
There is a problem however with this
course of action. Tharn, in his fear, has made
the Imperial Palace inaccessible. If you have
been there you already know the Guards are
under orders to turn all who approach back.
I think that I can circumvent this with a Spell
of Altering but it will mean the last of the
energy holding me in this form. I will gladly
sacrifice myself however, so that Tharn can
pay for his betrayal.
The spell I cast will alter other's perceptions
of your appearence. The Guards posted
outside the Imperial Palace should be fooled
and allow you entry. I only hope it will be
enough. You have done more than a hero
could be asked. This is the final step of a
long journey. Take heart and go forward
with my blessings. I thank you, in the
Emperor's name...& 

#1305
Isn't that just a legend...?&

I honestly have no idea. Try someone else, maybe they can help...&

Have you tried asking at a temple? They seem to know everything...&

Sorry friend, I thought that was just a myth.&

No one's heard of that in the past five hundred years...&

You wouldn't be the first searching for that. Why don't you try somewhere in
the cities of %cp. I heard something happened there...&

Have you tried near %cp? I heard something strange happened thereabouts...&

Couriers from %cp came here not yesterday speaking of the same thing!
Perhaps you should travel there to find out the truth...&

Try the local inn. Tales are flying back and forth about something unearthed
in the province of %cp. Maybe you should check there...&

There ain't no such thing!&

Why don't you try somewhere in the wilds of %cp. I think that the legends
say that %cll was located there, but I'm really not sure...&

I heard that %cll was actually somewhere in the wilderness of %cp. I don't
want to mislead you however. I'm really not very sure...&

#1306
Someone at the palace said that they found something in %ccs. You might
try there...&

I don't know much about %cll, but something about it was mentioned by a
traveller from %ccs. Maybe you should look there...&

Last I heard the Mage's Guild was looking somewhere near %ccs, or was it
%rcn? I'm not sure, but you should probably start your search around
there...&

There may be something in or near %ccs, I heard that a Temple
found something and has deciphered its location...&

I'd check in %ccs. Some strange things have been happening around
there...&

Well, its funny you should ask about that. The latest news is that something
was found near %ccs. I'd check there for more information. Try an inn
perhaps...&

Didn't someone unearth a clue in %ccs? I'd try searching near there,
someone in that city-state might have some more information...&

There has been strange talk of %cll being near %ccs. If the rumors are true,
you may want to start searching there...&

The only thing I've heard about %cll came from a traveller from %ccs.
Maybe you should start there...&

I don't know much about %cll, but I did overhear a man in a bar talk of
something having been unearthed in %ccs. Hope that information helps...&

#1307
I'll bet that some of the stuff recently uncovered in a keep outside the
city showed the location of Fang Lair. I'd check at the Palace see what
they say. Be careful though, a band of knights was seen attacking any who
left the city...&

I think it's pretty much common knowledge that someone at the Palace here
in Rihad claimed to have uncovered the location of Fang Lair. Someone
else told me that they actually were attacked by knights! I'd be careful
around there...&

Check at the Palace, they claimed to have deciphered the location of Fang
Lair from some ancient scrolls their guards found in a keep outside the
city...&

#1308
The Labyrinthian's twisted corridors could trap you forever. It seems
however that you are certain of this choice, so I implore you to check with
the Mage's Guild. They have come upon hard times, and would probably
help you with any quest that would give them knowledge...&

I heard that knights out of the Fortress of Ice rode into town last night and
attacked the Mage's Guild in search of a map to the Labyrinthian! Check at
the Guild, they may be able to help you...&

The Labyrinthian is said to hold treasures beyond imagination, and dangers
that can kill those not fully prepared. The only place I'd think to ask is the
Mage's Guild. If anyone had information, they would...&

#1309
It is said that there are those in the Palace that guard the secret of the
Elden Grove. Perhaps if you ask them, they will aid you in finding it.
Beware though, they are sure to exact a price...&

Elden Grove, I thought it was just legend. There are many who think that
the %t of the city knows the real location, and guards that knowledge...&

Few know of the legendary Elden Grove. Take your questions to the
Palace. The %t will perhaps be able to help you on your quest...&


#1310
I heard that some priests found something just outside the city. They took
whatever it was to the Mage's Guild. I'd check there for more
information...&

A couple of days ago some priests rode out of here in a hurry. They were
chased by a small group from the Mage's Guild. If you ask there, the Magi
may tell you more...&

I heard that the priests of Agamanus have declared war on the Mage's
Guild! It is said that their conflict arose over something the priests found
which may lead to the Halls of the Colossus. I'd check the Mage's Guild for
more information...&


#1311
The Crystal Tower is a nexus of power, known by all Mages as the crucible
of magic. You should ask the Mage's Guild for any information about it,
though I'd guess they would tell you little or nothing...&

It is said that the Mages Guild seeks the Crystal Tower for some artifact of
great power with which they can fight the followers of the Mad God.
Perhaps if you were to go to the Mage's Guild and ask them, they would
agree to help in return for some payment...&

All mages at one time or another seek the Crystal Tower for it is the crux
of magic in the world. Those who know not where to begin often seek
counsel at the Mage's Guild. Perhaps you should try there...&



#1312
The sun must have addled your wits! The Crypt of Hearts is just legend,
and even if it were real, it would be a most dangerous place. If you are bent
upon this course, you can of course check at the Brotherhood of Seth. It is
said that they hold many clues to the location...&

I would not wish to travel there, legend or not. I did hear however, that the
Brotherhood of Seth found clues to the location of the Crypt in the Mines
of Khuras. You might want to go ask the priests for more information...&

The priests of the Brotherhood of Seth were ever a secretive lot, one that
did not share information lightly. Still, I think that if you wish to uncover
the Crypt of Hearts, you must begin your search at the Temple itself...&

#1313
I heard that the priests in the Conclave of Baal in Stormhold
know the location of Murkwood, yet hold it a dear secret. I doubt they will
tell you the truth, unless it's for the right price...&

Fengris of the market told my brother that his son overheard two men
talking about something about a map to Murkwood being in a collapsed
portion of the Conclave of Baal. Maybe you should ask there...&

Although it is not common knowledge, I heard that a great spell caused the
collapse of a part of the Conclave of Baal in Stormhold, the part
that held much of their maps and treasure. If information to Murkwood is
anywhere, it'll be with them...&



#1314
It was rumored that Dwarves built a secret opening to the Mount of Dagoth-
Ur. Now any knowledge of that is lost, unless the Palace kept records. You
may wish to go and inquire there...&

Dagoth-Ur, why in the Lady's name would you wish to journey there?
Well, I cannot help you, but the Palace is said to keep records of many
things. Perhaps they would know... &

Many have journeyed to the Mount in search of great treasure, but few
have been heard of again. Those who survived its fiery slopes spoke of
demons. If you are bent on traveling this journey, check at the Palace, they
usually keep records of these things...&


#1315
Welcome to Rihad, %pcn. I am %t %rf, and I agree to tell you about Fang
Lair, for a favor. You see, not too long ago a band of goblins, led by
Golthog the Dark attacked this stronghold. They carried away with them
much treasure, including a parchment which held within its writings clues
to decipher the part of the Elder Scrolls which spoke of the location of the
legendary Fang Lair. Golthog and his goblins fled to an ancient and
ruined fortress called Stonekeep, outside the city. I fear that a large
band of mercenaries or soldiers will be unable to find them. A single person
however, would be much more successful. Perhaps your arrival is
fortuitous. If you would agree to try and recover this parchment, I will
inscribe the location of the Stonekeep onto your map. If you are successful
and return with the parchment, I will be able to decipher the location of
Fang Lair. I promise to give you that location as reward for your help. Do
you agree?&


#1316
Excellent. Stonekeep lies near Rihad. Be careful, Golthog is crafty
and evil. It is even rumored that he is a necromancer serving the
Underking. When you have the parchment, return with it here and I will
find out the location of Fang Lair for you...
%t %rf smiles broadly and motions for you to take your leave...&


#1317
I am sorry that you cannot help us now. If you should change your
mind, come ask again of Fang Lair. I will be pleased to have an
opportunity to recover the parchment...
%t %rf nods for you to excuse yourself from %g3 presence...&


#1318
It is a pleasure to see you again, %pcn. I trust that you are
ready to recover the parchment from Golthog at Stonekeep?
As you already know, if you agree I will tell you the location of
Fang Lair as a reward. What do you say?&

#1319
You have recovered the parchment! I hope you put Golthog into an early
grave as well. Still, I will complete my end of the bargain...

%t %rf motions to a courtier who respectfully bows and brings forward a
pen. Staring intently at the parchment, the %t takes a few moments and
then inscribes the location of Fang Lair, somewhere in the province of
Hammerfell, onto your map...&

#1320
You could not recover the parchment! Golthog is a dangerous foe, not
one to be taken lightly. Rest yourself. If you feel up to trying again later, I
will be happy to assist you...
The %t dismisses you with a wave of %g3 hand...&


#1321
Welcome, %pcn, to Winterhold. I trust that the weather has not affected
you adversely? Well, it has come to my attention that there have been
certain inquiries about the Labyrinthian. My name is Thelen Kaarn, and I
find this quite interesting. Few have sought out this legendary place, many
less have found it. Perhaps we can do each other a favor. Allow me to
explain.
A few days ago knights from the Fortress of Ice attacked a small caravan
destined for our Guild. This caravan was to deliver to us an object of
unimaginable importance, a missing tablet that would help decipher a part
of the Elder Scrolls. This piece completed a map to the Labyrinthian. No
doubt the knights returned with their booty to their Fortress, and are by
now deeply ensconced within its walls. We could not hope to get in there
and recover that tablet piece. We are not prepared for such an endeavor. If
you would agree to attempt this, I would gladly tell you location of the
Labyrinthian. All I need is the missing piece to solve the puzzle. Will you
agree to help us?&

#1322
I am pleased to see that you do not shy from danger. Enough talk then,
here is the location of the Fortress of Ice. When you have the missing
piece, return here with it and I will share with you the location of the
Labyrinthian...
Thelen gestures once and the location of the Fortress of Ice is magically
inscribed onto your map...&

#1323
I had wished that you would not shy from danger, but I can understand
your decision. If you change your mind, I will await your return. Just
ask again of the Labyrinthian here at the Guild, and I will try and help...
Thelen bids you farewell, then walks down a corridor and out of sight...&

#1324
Welcome again to Winterhold's Mage's Guild, %pcn. I had hoped you
would wish to speak again on this matter. The knights grow restless, I
think they mean to move our treasures elsewhere. If they do so, we will not
be able to recover the missing piece of the Elder Scrolls, and the location
of the Labyrinthian will be lost forever. Will you help me recover the
tablet?&


#1325
I had hoped and prayed for your safe return. I see you were successful.
Your deeds will be sung among the tales of heroes. If you will wait a
moment, I will give you what I promised...

Thelen fits the piece into a larger tablet, then reads what is written. He
gestures for your map. With a feather pen he inscribes the location of the
Labyrinthian, somewhere in the Skyrim Province, onto your map...&

#1326
I see that you where unsuccessful against the knights of the Fortress of Ice.
Perhaps you should prepare using what you have learned of their defenses.
You may rest in town as long as you feel necessary. The option to
try and recover the missing piece of the Elder Scroll lies with you. If you
decide to try again, bring the piece back here to me. I will await your
successful return...

Thelen smiles kindly, patting your shoulder. He then turns his attention to
his work, satisfied that your needs have been met...&


#1327
You ask us for the location of the Elden Grove, birthplace of the sacred
First Tree. Such knowledge has a price. Over the past year we have seen
our beautiful Valenwood change. Parts have become unsafe for travelers,
others have turned dark and sinister, leeching the very earthblood from the
soil. Alerion, greatest of our Loremasters, found bodies of our people
sucked dry of all fluid. They lay wasted, living dead that had no memories
of their former existence. Sadly, they had to be destroyed.
Ten of our rangers left to search through the Valenwood Forests, hoping
for a clue to this mystery. Two months later their severed heads were
delivered to us by an emissary of someone who calls herself Selene, High
Priestess of Shagrath, the God of Spiders. She delivered to us an
ultimatum. Surrender Valenwood or die!
We are not a fighting people, and have no standing army. We prefer to
dwell here amongst the trees and mother earth, rejoicing in the commune of
the land. We cannot stand against Selene and her spider warriors. I fear an
end to my people and our way of life.
You seem to be a strong and formidable adventurer. I implore you, put an end
to her threat against us. I will inscribe on your map the location her
emissary referred to as 'Selene's Web', sight of our supposed surrender.
Somewhere in those dark corridors lies the one thing that can safeguard
us from her greed. Somewhere in her fortress lies her 'heart'. It is said
to be a great jewel into which she has infused her lifeforce. If you
bring us this jewel, she would dare not attack us with her life in the
balance. If you are successful, we will share with you the sacred
knowledge of the Elden Grove. Will you help us?&

#1328
You are truly a compassionate soul. Know this, Selene's Web lies near
the city of Eldenroot. I pray, be careful, she is a powerful sorceress
who consorts with the undead. I wish thee luck on thy quest...

%t %rf inscribes the location of Selene's Web onto your map...&

#1329
I fear then that we will vanish as a people. %pcn, I understand your
reluctance, but please consider my people and their fate. If you should
change your mind, I would gladly welcome your assistance.

%t %rf smiles sadly, %g3 face etched in grief. It seems that you are free to
leave...&

#1330
I see you have returned to us. I hope you have changed your mind and are
willing to find the High Priestess of Shagrath and bring us her heart. Our
people will be forever in your debt for their deliverance.
I will tell you the location of the Elden Grove as a small token of my
gratitude if you are successful. Will you help us in our time of need?


#1331
I and my people owe a debt we cannot begin to pay, %pcn. You have
given us a new hope, and for that we are eternally grateful. Come and stand
before me...

%t %rf gently unrolls an ancient scroll, then takes a light feather pen and
inscribes the location of the Elden Grove, somewhere in the Valenwood
Province, onto your map...&


#1332
Selene and her spider warriors are a formidable opponent. I hold no blame
for your failure. Rest and be at peace. If you wish to try again, I would be
most grateful...

%t %rf motions to some of the retinue, who come forward to help you
from the throne room...&

#1333
You are %pcn. Word of your inquiries concerning the Halls of Colossus
have spread through the City, and have come to my attention. I am
Turamane ap' Kolthis, Loremaster of the Mage's Guild, here in Corinth.
Perhaps we can help each other.
A few days ago a band of warrior-priests from the Temple of Agamanus
attacked the Guild. They claimed that we had stolen from them a stone
tablet that was sacred to their sacrament. In truth, we found the tablet
amongst ruins far from here. But their leader, Sir Galandir, must have
known the true nature of the tablet. It held the key to deciphering a part of
the Elder Scrolls, the part that shows the location of the Halls of Colossus.
After the attack, my Guild was left too weak to retaliate.
If you will agree to recover the stone tablet, I will inscribe the location of
the Temple of Agamanus onto your map. If you are successful, I will be
able to decipher the location of the Halls and tell them to you. However, to
do this I need the stone tablet first. Will you agree to help me? (y/n)&


#1334
You are brave and fair, and I humbly thank you for your help. You
will find the Temple of Agamanus near Corinth. May the Lady bless
your endeavors, and may you fare well on your journey...

Turamane inscribes the location of the Temple of Agamanus, Sir Galandir's
fortress, onto your map...&

#1335
It is a shame, for none of us can recover the stone tablet. I fear its
knowledge is lost forever. If you should change your mind, come
see me again...
Turamane leaves, shaking his head...&

#1336
%oth, %pcn, it is good to see you! If you recover the stone tablet taken there
by Sir Galandir, I will be able to decipher it and tell you the location of the
Halls of Colossus. He will assuredly try and stop you, but you seem most
capable. My offer to inscribe the location onto your map still stands. Can
you help?&


#1337
I see you have recovered the stone tablet, %pcn. I trust Sir Galandir and
his knights did you no permanent harm? Now, for my part of the bargain.
Wait a moment while I get my notes...

Turamane gets a feather pen and then peers intently at the tablet. A few
moments later he inscribes the location of the Halls of Colossus,
somewhere in the province of Elsweyr, onto your map...&

#1338
Sir Galandir and his knights are a troublesome lot. I fear that if you were
unable to retrieve the tablet, it is lost forever. We must take heart though,
nothing is to say that you cannot try again, perhaps when you've healed.
Recover the tablet and bring it back here, I will await your return...

Turamane smiles sadly, then retreats into the shadows...&

#1339
My name is Corim Ashlen, and I have the dubious honor of being the
Loremaster of this Mage's Guild. Word has spread that you seek the
Crystal Tower. I have known students of mine to search an entire
lifetime, never destined to walk within its hallowed halls. I will however
consider doing something I would have never thought to do. I will help you
find the Crystal Tower. In return you must do a favor for me first.
You see, a few nights ago priests of the Mad God attacked our Guild. They
were protected by some sort of spell that absorbed our magic, making us
powerless to stop them. Many of our initiates died, and the priests carried
off a number of our treasured artifacts. Among these was a small diamond.
I cannot speak more of this, other than to say it serves a vital purpose here
in the Guild by strengthening our magic. It has a secondary function as
well, one that would be of interest to you.
I quested and won this magical gem in fair combat from its previous
master, the Demi-Lich Zaraphus. It is said that the light from the gem will
allow the viewer to see the true location of the Crystal Tower on a
specially prepared map, a map I have in my study. The priests however
have the diamond. If you would consider recovering it, I would be happy
to show you the location of the Crystal Tower. You will however, have to
bring me the diamond first. Do you agree?&

#1340
Good. You will find the Temple of the Mad God outside the city of
Lillandril. Wait a moment while I get a pen and mark the location on
your map. Remember, bring me the diamond and I will show you the
location of the Crystal Tower as a reward...

Corim inscribes the location of the Temple of the Mad God onto your
map...&

#1341
I truly wished you had agreed to help. I understand however that you
may have other concerns. If you should change your mind, return here
and ask me again about the Crystal Tower...

Corim nods once, disappointment clearly etched into his face...&

#1342
Welcome back, %pcn. I hope you have decided to try and recover the
diamond from the priests of the Mad God. They probably do not expect a
retaliation from us, so your chances of sneaking in are sure to be very
good. You may run into their priests, but you look strong enough to deal
with them. It shouldn't be too difficult to recover the diamond now. Do
you agree?&

#1343
Well done, %pcn. You have done this Guild a service it will not easily
forget. I thank you for your efforts. Now, for my part of the bargain...

Corim walks to a table where an ornately penned map lies. There, he
focuses a shaft of light through the diamond. A moment later he
inscribes the location of the Crystal Tower, somewhere in the
Summurset Province, onto your map...&

#1344
%oth, the priests of the Mad God must truly be insane if they think they can get
away with this sacrilege. %pcn, rest until you are strong enough. You may
try to recover the diamond again, when you feel up to it...

The Loremaster bows once and walks away, muttering angry curses at the
priests of the Mad God...&

#1345
I welcome you to the Brotherhood of Seth, %pcn. Word of your inquiries
concerning the Crypt of Hearts has come to my attention. I am Halfas
Varn, senior Brother in this temple. I would gladly help you on your quest,
but dire times are upon us. One of our brethren, Barnabas of Tethis, went
mad, raving that the Emperor had been captured! He insisted that only
something called the Staff of Chaos could free the Emperor from his fate.
Naturally we did not believe him, he was ever one live in fanciful dreams.
Instead, we tried our best to soothe him, talking to him of brighter, happier
things. We thought he was fine.
Yesterday afternoon he went berserk and killed Brother Martinus, then fled
from the temple. With him he took a scroll that he claimed would help him
find a piece of the missing so-called Staff of Chaos. I fear he has gone to
the Mines of Khuras, the place where he claimed the map said he would
find his first clue. What he doesn't realized is that the map he carries was
originally found in the Mines. Part of the inscription on the map is a code
that we planned to use to decipher the location of the Crypt of Hearts from
the Elder Scrolls. Without that map, we haven't a chance. If only there was
a way of recovering the map, but the Mines of Khuras are too dangerous.
Poor Brother Barnabas has surely perished by now. I will tell you how to
get to the Mines. There you can search for the map, or Brother Barnabas.
I think it unlikely that you will find either, but there is always a slim
chance. If you return to me with the map, I will tell you the location of
the Crypt of Hearts. It is a fool's errand, but such is your only hope.
Do you wish to search the Mines?&

#1346
I had thought you would decline, faced with the danger of the mines.
Lava pools and fire pits are scattered throughout its scorched corridors. You
must find something to protect you from the heat of its fires. Hopefully
you will find both Brother Barnabus and the map. No matter, the Mines of
Khuras are located near Camlorn. If you find the map, return here to the
Brotherhood of Seth. I will tell you the location of the Crypt of Hearts...

Brother Halfas gestures and you see on your map the location of the Mines
of Khuras magically appear...&

#1347
I understand, for I had named it rightly, a fool's errand. Brother
Barnabas is long gone, and I've heard the Mines are treacherous, even
were you a legendary Dwarf! You are wiser than I thought. Still, should
you change your mind and wish to search the fiery Mines, I will be here.
Simply ask about the Crypt of Hearts and I will be sent for. Fare thee
well, %pcn...

Brother Halfas smiles good-naturedly, then retires to his desk, leafing
through his work with patience...&


#1348
I see you are still interested in the Mines of Khuras. I still think you are one
of wishful thinking, but if you are interested, I will point out its location. If
you do manage somehow to recover the map, bring it here and I will tell
you the location of the Crypt of Hearts. Do you wish to explore the Mines?&

#1349
Unbelievable! I did not credit you with the tenacity you obviously possess.
For my part, I gave my word to tell you the location of the Crypt of Hearts,
and Gods do not suffer men whose words carry no weight. Hold a moment
while I read this map...

Brother Halfas takes the map you recovered and goes into another room.
Almost an hour goes by before he returns. He nods knowingly to you and
then asks for your map. Quickly he sketches out the location of the Crypt
of Hearts, somewhere in High Rock Province...&

#1350
I am not surprised, the Mines of Khuras are complex and supposedly
unending. Brother Barnabas could be anywhere in there. Though it seems a
daunting task, you may want to use what you've learned of the Mines to
better prepare. Remember, few have entered the Mines, but fewer still have
ever returned. You are welcome to return to me if you ever find the map...

Brother Halfas bows once and walks back to his study, where he turns his
full attention to his work...&

#1351
Aye, my child, I knew the way to find the location of Murkwood, the dark
forest that ever moves, for I am Idolan Lancaster, Leader of the
Conclave of Baal. Though it is a dire place, it is said that many
items were lost within its swamps and bogs. Alas, I fear its secrets will rest
forever now.
You see, a few nights ago one of our initiates, thinking to impress his
masters, triggered a spell of massive destructive potential. Though the
senior brothers tried to dissipate it, they were not able. The best they could
do was to channel its power into the very earth itself. Needless to say the
backlash was terrible, collapsing much of the Vaults of Gemin, the site this
unfortunate apprentice had chosen to cast his spell. The stone tablet that
held the key to the location of Murkwood fell with much of the Vault, deep
below the earth. I dare say it is lost forever unless...
If you would be willing to venture into the collapsed Vault and try and
recover the tablet, I would be happy to decipher the location of Murkwood
and inscribe it onto your map. You would have to return the tablet to me
first, however. Will you agree?&

#1352
You are doing a great service to the Conclave of Baal. I will
not forget it. Be careful however, for we have heard strange noises
issuing forth from the dark caverns below. When you have retrieved the
tablet, return to this place. I will await you...&

#1353
Your fear is understood. My brothers and I will continue the
excavation. If you should change your mind, come inquire about
Murkwood again. I will welcome a chance to recover the tablet...

Idolan bows respectfully and then departs to help with the restoration...&

#1354
Welcome back, %pcn! %oth, it is truly a pleasure to see you. I hope you will try
and recover the tablet from the Vaults of Gemin. My brothers have done
great work in restoring the upper sections, but the underdark is still a place
we dare not venture. My original offer stands, bring back the tablet and I
will inscribe the location of Murkwood for you on your map. Will you
help?&

#1355
The Vaults are no safe place for those not strong in arm and wit. Still, it
seems you have succeeded in quite an arduous task. Wait a moment and I
will complete our bargain...

Idolan peers intently at the tablet, then rummages through his robes for a
feather pen. A helpful brother holds out an ink well and Idolan pens the
location of Murkwood, somewhere in the province of Black Marsh, onto
your map...&

#1356
There is no shame in returning empty-handed. The caverns below are
treacherous to even the most seasoned of veterans. Please, if you wish to,
you may try again. For now, rest and heal...

Idolan smiles sadly, patting you on your shoulder before joining some of
his brethren in prayer...&

#1357
My name is %t %rf, and I have heard that you seek Dagoth-Ur, the
legendary home of the Dwarven people. Perhaps we can help one another.
I have in my possession the Anvil of Mithas, greatest of the Dwarven
blacksmiths. Only one object was strong enough not to shatter when used
to shape metal upon the Anvil, the Hammer of Gharen. It is said that the
ring of the Hammer upon the Anvil speaks to the user, telling him the
entrance to the Mount of Dagoth-Ur. With the raw metals present within
the mountain, my blacksmiths will be able to fashion the finest weapons and
armor in the realm! Recover the Hammer for me. It was supposedly lost in
the dungeon known as the Black Gate. I will show you where this dungeon
can be found. You will be rewarded for this deed with the location of the
entrance to Dagoth-Ur. You can then journey there and explore it to your
heart's content. Do you agree?&

#1358
You do me a great service, %pcn. One that I nor my people will easily
forget. Come, here is the location of the Black Gate...

%t %rf inscribes the location of the Black Gate, home of the Hammer of
Gharen, onto your map...&

#1359
I understand your reluctance, but think of it. You will be aiding the
realm in relearning the lost art of Dwarven smithcraft. Do not make so
hasty a judgment, I beg of you. If you change your mind, return here
and ask me of Dagoth-Ur. I will await your return...

%t %rf gestures for you to be dismissed, %g3 face marked with concern
over your decision...

#1360
I hope that you have decided to help me in this matter. The Hammer awaits
you in the Black Gate. Recover it and I will be able to find the entrance to
Dagoth-Ur, information that I will share with you. Do you agree?&

#1361
Well done, %pcn. You have done the realm a service it will not easily
forget. Smiths across the land will hail your arrival. Now, for my part of
the bargain...

%t %rf rings the Hammer of Gharen onto the Anvil, listening intently. A
slow smile spreads across %g3 features. Gesturing to you, %g inscribes the
location of the entrance to Dagoth-Ur, somewhere in the northern part of
Morrowind, onto your map...&

#1362
It seems the Black Gate was more than you could handle. No matter, the
option to try again lies with you. You may rest as long as you like. Use
your experience with the area to prepare. When you are ready, journey
back to the Black Gate and recover for me the Hammer of Gharen. I will
await your successful return...

%t %rf nods once kindly, gesturing for you to dismiss yourself, then turns
%g3 attention to other matters of the state...&


#1363
You have found the Parchment the court at Rihad can use to discover the
location of Fang Lair...&

#1364
You have found the Tablet that Thelen Kaarn spoke of. Once he has hold of
it, he can use it to decipher the location of the Labyrinthian...&

#1365

the people of Eldenroot. You have only to bring it to the ruler there...&

the Corinth Mages' Guild. When Turamane has it again he can use it to find
the location of the legendary Halls of Colossus...&

#1367
You have found the Diamond Corim Ashlen sent you to recover. Only he can
use it to see the Crystal Tower's location...&

#1368
You have found the Map fragment, only slightly discolored by Brother
Barnabas' blood. With the help of the Brotherhood of Seth, you may succeed
where Barnabas failed...&

#1369
You have found the Tablet Idolan Lancaster sent you to recover. Once it is
in his hands, he can direct you toward Murkwood ...&

#1370
You have found the legendary Hammer of Gharen. Once it is united with its
mate, the Anvil of Mithas in the palace at Ebonheart, it will ring with the
location of the secret entrance to Dagoth-Ur...&

#1371
The first piece of the Staff of Chaos flashes once before turning to a dull
piece of ebony in your hand. You can feel it perceptibly throbbing as if
waiting to be connected to the other seven pieces...&

#1372
The second piece of the Staff of Chaos burns brightly with cold fire as it
touches the first piece. They meld together perfectly...&

#1373
The third piece of the Staff of Chaos melds onto the other two with a low
hum. The throbbing of the ebony rod is faster now, as though hungry to be
reunited with its brethren...&

#1374
The fourth piece of the Staff of Chaos fastens itself to the other three in
a flash of blue light. The Staff is now half complete...&

#1375
You attach the fifth piece of the Staff and for a moment feel a surge of
energy pass into your body, almost as if the incomplete Staff were a live thing...&

#1376
The sixth piece of the Staff of Chaos slides into the nearly complete rod
like a sword into a sheath...&

#1377
The seventh piece attaches itself to the rest of the Staff, infusing it
with a fiery glow that only dims slightly in time...&

#1378
You have found the last piece of the Staff of Chaos. As though a living thing,
it flies to complete the Staff. The whole burns brightly with cold fire and
you can feel the strength of this conduit as though it were your own strength...&

#1386
My name, %n. I am proud to be a member of the %t's guard.
You are addressing %n, an officer of %t %rf's royal guard.
I am %n, one of the %ct guards. Conduct yourself while in %cn, %ra.

#1387
You've asked me that before, feeble-minded %ra. I am %n, %ct guardsman.
A poor memory for names, %ra? I am still %n, guardsman of %cn.
Last time you asked I was %n, guardsman to %t %rf. Lo, I am still the same.

#1388
Excellent! I've inscribed the location of the place on your map of Tamriel,
use that to guide you. Good luck to you, %pcf. May your mission be a
success.&

You are doing a great deed for %cn, %pcf. The exact location of the
dungeon has been inscribed on your map of Tamriel, so you may travel
efficiently. Fair luck be yours, %pcf.&

You are a brave %ra indeed, %pcf. I have inscribed the exact
location of the dungeon on your map of Tamriel. Use that to guide you. Good
luck and good speed, %pcf.&

#1389
Then you shall be my champion, %pcn. Be careful, young %ra, and good
luck.&

Excellent, %pcf, you are brave indeed. I and all %cn will be relying on
you. Move quickly, take care of yourself, and good luck be yours.&
I am happy to make you my champion, %pcn, but I will be happier still when
this business is behind us. Thank you, young %ra, and good luck.&

#1390
The %mn has no gold or usable items.&

#1391
You are my savior, good %ra. Goodbye and good luck.&
%oth, the good spirits must have delivered you indeed. I am relying on you,
%pcf, do not let me down.&
Thank you, %pcf. My mind is much eased. Good luck to you, good %ra.&

#1392
I do not know who you are, but you have made a fatal mistake. Ria Silmane
and her feeble powers are no protection for you. I should have discorporated
her when I had the chance. I will not make the same mistake again. I will
use the same dream bridge that she uses, sending my minions across time and
space. Already they arrive, ones worthy of the attention you deserve. They will
relieve you of the burden of the Staff piece you now hold. Give it to them
and I will order your death painless and quick. Resist and I shall see
you in such suffering that you will grovel for the sweet release of death...&

#1393
You have survived the tests most dire. Continue along
this path however and you will face such things as to make your very
heart freeze. I will save you the ordeal for my servants approach you even
now. From your mangled corpse I will take what is mine...&

#1394
Why do you choose to align against me when it is obvious that
I will destroy you. Even as each piece of the Staff comes into your
possession it becomes easier to find you, and I have done just that. Face
my creatures, if you dare. I am through toying with you...&

#1395
It is obvious, whoever you are, that you are a cunning and worthy foe. Perhaps
Ria chose well, even if it was her last act. I will not insult your
intelligence with further digression. My minions soon
approach, but I will not consign you to the dark door of Death.
You have proven your worth. Once you are killed, I will raise you to
fight for me, as one of my servants. Give in to me now and I offer you
everlasting life...&

#1396
I have underestimated you, that is clear. You not only have defeated the
useless creatures I have sent against you, but managed to survive encounters 
that in and of itself could be the stuff of legends. It is sad
that I am forced to destroy you. Prepare, for my minions arrive...&

#1397
You have rejected my offer of everlasting life. Your list of accomplishments
grow. You will not however, accomplish the forging of the Staff. My forces
are inexhaustible, and you will succumb. Prepare, for my servants arrive...&

#1398
You amaze me with your tenacity. This game however, is at an end. As you
may already know, the final piece of the Staff is in Dagoth-Ur, in the
province of Morrowind. The information is useless to you, for none know the
entrance to the volcano, and even if you survive the creatures I have sent
against you now, you will not survive its depths. I bid you farewell, %pcf.
You have been a most worthy opponent...&

#1399
I congratulate you on your success. Have you discovered however, what
I have known all along? The Staff is drained of all magical potential. I
did it myself before scattering the pieces across the realm. It is a useless
stick, good for churning butter or rowing a boat, but not for saving the
Emperor. Come find me if you dare, and I will relieve you of any further
burdens you may think to face. My legions await...&

#1400
Do not fear for it is I, Ria Silmane.
%pcf, listen to me, there are no others left to
carry on this fight. You have been left in this cell
to die. Jagar Tharn, Imperial Battle Mage of Tamriel
has taken on the guise of the true Emperor. He does 
not see you as a threat, being only a minor part of
the Imperial Court. In that act of arrogance, he has
made his first mistake. Look to the north wall of this
cell. You will find a ruby key which will unlock the
door. Take it and make your escape. The passages here
were once used by Tharn to hide treasures he had stolen
from the Emperor's coffers. If you wish, you can gather
enough to support yourself away from the Imperial Seat.
Be careful, there are many creatures which inhabit the
sewers now, vile rats and goblins. It is too late for me,
for I am already dead. Only my powers as a Sorceress keep
me between this life and the next. That power however is
waning. Do not succumb to greed or you may find these
tunnels to be your final resting place as well. I can still
work my magic to a certain extent. If you travel west from
this cell, then south, you will find a Shift Gate. It will
transport you far enough from the center of the Empire that
you should be safe. If you survive these sewers you will see
me again. Remember, %pcf, Tharn has taken on the guise of the
Emperor. No one will gainsay his word for yours. I will come to
you again in your dreams, so it is imperative that you rest
from time to time. In that way I will be able to communicate
with you and lend my aid. You are entering a dangerous arena,
my friend, one in which the players are beings beyond your
mortal comprehension. I do not envy your role. There is
however a power within you as yet untapped. Look for me when
you have gained experience in the world. You are my last and
best hope...&

#1401
You have proven yourself a worthy champion of the Empire, and such
service shall not easily be forgotten. Hang not your sword above
the mantle, nor place your spellbook upon the shelves. Many such
adventures still await your hand. This was but one chapter in the
story of the Elder Scrolls...& 

#1402
With you died our last hope for justice. Tharn is now
free to do as he will. It saddens me to see the beautiful
land of Tamriel rotting from within. Goodbye, %pcf. I
wish you peace in the afterworld...&

#1403
You were a fool to confront me, and now have paid the
ultimate price. Even now my servants go to fetch your
mortal husk. You will serve me well through my years
as Emperor, once I have made you undead. Perhaps I
will even let you retain some of your memories, so that
the price of your failure has meaning to you....&


#1404
You must not! The Jewel holds my lifeforce!!!&

#1405
Thou art truly a child of the Empire. I thank thee for thy assistance.&

#1406
It seems, %pcf, that I am quite in the way.
Not only have you managed to save the
Emperor, but my life as well. I cannot be but
proud of one who has truly earned such
renown, and my deepest respect...&

#1407
I have a particular idea as to the question of
your service in mind...
From this day forth, thou art named the
Eternal Champion. From thy
hand shall be dealt the needs of the Empire.
I, Uriel Septim, true Emperor of Tamriel do
decree, and thus make law. Arise my
Champion, and take thy rightful place at my side...&

#1409
Thy race is descended from the ancient
Druids of Galen, quick witted
and strong in the mystical arts.
Thy folk are crafty and intelligent,
a learned people who use their gifts
to guide others to enlightenment...&

#1410
Thy race is a people without a past,
for in the Tiber War thou wert stalwart
guardians of Hammerfell. As time moved on
thy people held onto the ground for which
they had shed tears of blood,
and now the land, and the strength and
endurance of rock itself, is thine own to command...&

#1411
Thy race is strong as the northern winds
which sweep through icy glaciers.
The arctic clime hast hardened thy folk
for life's cruel and bitter hand...&

#1412
Thy race is as deadly as the thorns of
the black rose which blooms only
in thy mother's breast. Thou hast all that
is graceful in thy brothers of day,
yet thy mother is the moon,
and thou art her children of the night...&

#1413
Thy race is tall and stately,
for thou art kings among princes.
Thy people were first on this land to
breathe the spring air and first to leap,
nimble with the wind. Thine eyes
canst see all even when naught is out
but the Mistress of the Night...&

#1414
Thy race is one with the forest
and its creatures, and thy strength
flows from the mother earth itself.
Thou art one with the world...&

#1415
Thy race is born of the desert,
where life is cruel and harsh and
death comes on vultures wings.
Thou art feline and sleek,
deadly hunters of the wastes...&

#1416
Thy race is born of the swamps,
thou hast stayed thyself
from the open fields,
for thou art hunters of a different sort,
those who stalk thy prey
in the still black waters...&

#1417
I can cut down the time but it'll cost more
How many days can you wait?&

#1418
I can cut the cost, but it'll take longer.
How much gold do you want to spend?&

#1419
Your %s should be ready 
any minute. I have one of my men
working on it as we speak.&

#1420
Your %s is not ready yet.
Check back with me in %u days.&

#1421
Your %s is not ready yet.
I am almost done with it.
Check back with me in %u hours.&

#1422
Welcome to the town of %cn,
held by %t %rf. We would appreciate
any business you can offer...&

You walk through the gates of %cn,
ruled by %t %rf.
The streets seem strangely quiet...&

The town of %cn greets you,
the people smiling in friendly welcome...&

#1423
You walk into the village of %cn weary from travel.
Ahead it seems are inns and taverns to refresh
yourself in...&

The village of %cn seems quiet, unaware of your arrival.
The people here seem very friendly...&

You arrive at %cn, a village held by %t %rf.
Although weary from travel, you find the place
seems to beckon for exploration...&


#1424
Sure I could fix that %i for
you. It'll take %t days and cost
%a gold. You want me to get started?&

Fixing that %i is no problem. It'll take %t days
and cost %a gold. Sound fair?&

#1425
Fine. I can get it done in %t days, but it'll
cost you %a gold. Is that okay?&

#1426
Fine, I'll charge you %a gp but it'll take %t days
to get done. Is that okay?&

#1427
Then I'll get started right away...&

Good, I'll get to it as soon as I can.&

#1428
I understand. You might consider dropping that
broken piece and buying yourself a new replacement.
I have very fair prices...&

Well, if you change your mind, I'll be here.&

#1429
You awake with a start. Someone has been rummaging through your pack, you
are sure of it.&

You are dreaming of someone standing over you, searching through your
belongings for something and finding what he seeks.&

There is a shuffling of feet and you hear someone run away. Your pack lies
open on the floor, its contents spilling at your feet. Something is
missing.&

#1430
Leave me alone.&
Listen, I came here to drink in peace. Do you mind?&
Looks like they'll let anyone into the %nt these days.&
I'm trying to a have a life. Go away.&
I'm not interested in anything you have to say.&
Go away.&
%oth, go away. I'd just like some peace and quiet.&
I came here to drink not talk. Do you mind?&
Why don't you talk to the bartender? He actually likes strangers.&
If you want to hear gossip, go talk to the bartender.&
Sorry, I don't think I know you, nor do I wish to.&
Why don't you go down to the morgue and tell them you're ready?&
Why don't you move closer to the wall? That's all ready plastered.&
I'd like to help you out - tell me, which way did you come in?&
%oth, I'm in no mood to be hassled by a drunk %ra.&
I want to be alone.&
No offense, %ra, but I don't need any company right now.&
I'm waiting for a friend. Why don't you just run along?&
I don't mean to be rude, but go away.&
I have zero interest in you or anything you have to say, %ra.&
Why don't you talk to that little fat guy? He's the bartender.&
%oth, do I look like I want to be bothered, %ra?&
I love %ra adventurers ... boiled.&
%oth, I never met a %ra I liked. Go away now.&
You seem like a nice enough %ra. Why don't you run along now?&
No one in %nt likes a stranger. Except the bartender, if you tip.&
Begone, o %ra. I don't wish to converse with you.&
You might find this hard to believe, but I don't want to be your friend.&
You know, I may be drunk but you're ugly. And I'll be sober later on.&
The bartender will be more than happy to help you. Just move along now.&
%oth, I forgot how many stupid %ra adventurers there are in the %nt.&
I'm sorry, but if you thought I looked friendly, you were mistaken.&
%oth! No offense, %ra, but would you mind stepping a little upwind of me?&
If you must bother someone, bother the bartender. He gets paid for it.&
Take my advice, %ra, get a double room. The single here is lice infested.&
Don't bother with a cheap room at the %nt, %ra. Get at least a double.&
You won't find any better ale in %cn than here at the %nt.&
%oth, who smells like an old horse in here? Oh, it's me.&
Do you mind, %ra? I was just having a chat with my invisible friend.&
I hate to see my favorite tavern overrun by %ra barbarians. No offense.&
See if the bartender has any claret left. It's the tastiest wine in %lp.&
Sorry. I'm a little drunk, %ra.&
Don't get too many strangers in the %nt. Not exactly a tourist spot.&
I'm not as think as you drink I am. Maybe it's time for a nap.&
If you're looking for a dungeon to crawl in, there's one right outside.&
The bartender would know if there's any work to be found in %cn.&
I haven't heard of any work, but the bartender is better informed than me.&
I'm here to drink. If you want to do business, talk to the bartender.&
Best ale in %cn, here at the %nt. Go drink some and leave me alone.&
Talk to the bartender, %ra. He's the only one at the %nt with information.&
%oth, don't bother me, %ra. The bartender can help you if you need it.&

#1447
I have watched as you blundered your way to this place. At one time I
even considered approaching you with an offer to lead my Imperial Guards,
but it is plain that you are not worthy of such a position. Be not fooled
by what you would call success in your journey across the Empire, for you
have never faced a being as powerful as I. Your death shall be slow and
torturous, a suffering that shall span the millenium. Come, I await you
in the dungeons below...&

#0000a 
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
fine trappings and furniture
that decorate the area. A hot
breeze wafts through the area,
drying the sweat from your body
and bringing a unpleasant sigh to
your lips. You relish at the idea of
a brief respite. Ahead of you
waits %rf, %t of %cn. It is well
known that %cn is currently at %st with its
neighbor, %cn2.&

Outside the sun batters
relentlessly on the citizens of
%cn, but in the audience chamber
of %rf, %t of the %ct, the
shadows are deliverance. The
rewards of power and wealth
decorate the room. Obviously,
being at %st with the %ct's
neighbor, %cn2, has been
profitable for the %t of %cn.
Perhaps you too can benefit from
this situation...&

You enter the audience
chamber of %rf, %t of %cn.
Despite the season, not a
ray of sunshine has touched this
room. You breath in the musty
air and wipe the sweat from your
brow as you wait for the %t to
finish business with some
messengers from %cn2, %cn's
neighbor. The behavior between
the %t and the messengers is
peculiar, considering the two
have been at %st for some time...&

#0000b
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
fine trappings and furniture
that decorate the area. Outside
you can still hear the raindrops
as they fall, soaking everything
in sight and creating a humid
haze which causes your clothes
to cling to you like a second
skin. Ahead of you waits %rf, %t
of %cn. It is well known that
%cn is currently at %st with its neighbor, %cn2.&

You enter the audience
chamber, wiping the warm sweat
of summer off of your
face. At the center of the
opulently decorated room, %t %rf
is speaking with the %ct
councilmen of %cn. You overhear
them mention %cn2, their
neighbor to the %di, with which
%cn is at %st.&

Like an unwanted dog, the
dry heat from the hot summer
has followed you to the audience
chamber of %rf, %t of
%cn. They whisper,
but you think you hear one of
the counselors remind the %t
that they are at %st with %cn2, the
%ct's neighbor to the %di.&

#0000c
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
fine trappings and furniture
that decorate the area. Even
though the clouds outside have
made everything seem dull and
gray, you find that the interior
is brightly lit and cheerful.
Ahead of you waits %rf, %t of
%cn. It is well known that %cn
is currently at %st with its
neighbor, %cn2.&

You enter %t %rf's audience
chamber, finding the %ct elders
in conference with the %t. The
mood in the room reflects the
weather outside; hot and dark
with rain clouds. The elders
continue to whisper nervously
one to the other.&

The audience chamber of %t
%rf of %cn is alive with
activity. The %t and an elder
discuss a discontented local
group who wish %cn no longer to
be at %st with its neighbor,
%cn2. You see the %t turn %g3
attention to a merchant whose shop
is under suspicion of housing a
Thieves' Guild...&

#0000d
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and
furniture that decorate the
area. Outside the golden fall
sun lends its heat to the interior.
Ahead of you waits
%rf, %t of %cn. It is well known
that %cn is currently at %st with
its neighbor, %cn2.&

It is the busiest season of
the year in %cn, and the
palace's audience chamber is
filled with area farmers
discussing their harvests with
%t %rf. Many linger in the room
after their business is through,
procrastinating the return to the burning
field work. They seem to be talking mostly about
%cn being suddenly at %st with its nearest neighbor,
%cn2, and how this will
change the trade throughout the province.&

It is unusually warm for the
autumn in %cn, but the audience chamber of %t %rf
reflects little of the sun's heat outside...&

#0000e
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber shaking the
hot rain from your shoulders.
The first thing you notice is
the many fine trappings and
furniture that decorate the
area. The desert air serves to
quickly dry you. Ahead of you
waits %rf, %t of %cn...&

You had hoped that the
chamber of the %t of %cn would
provide relief from the hot
autumn rain outside, but it is
as damp and chilly as a
mausoleum. Others seeking
audience wait with dripping hair
and chattering teeth, as %t %rf
talks with a representative from
%cn2, the %ct's neighbor that
%cn is at %st with...&

It has been an uncomfortably
hot autumn in the %ct of %cn,
so the recent shower has
actually improved the mood in
the audience chamber of %t %rf.
You know that %cn2, %cn's temperamental neighbor, is only
recently at %st with %t %rf, but
foreign diplomacy is not being discussed among the %t and the
circle of counselors.&

#0000f
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and furs
that decorate the area. Even
though autumn's clouds outside
have made everything seem dark
and gray, you find that the
interior is brightly lit and
warm. Ahead of you waits %rf, %t
of %cn. It is well known that
%cn is currently at %st with its neighbor, %cn2.&

You enter %t %rf's audience
chamber, shaking the heat of
the gray autumn day from your
skin. Being currently at %st with
its neighbor %cn2, the leading citizens of %cn have met to
discuss the resultant implications with their %t...&

As you enter the audience
chamber of the %t of %cn, you
feel the autumn heat from the
outside is actually intensified within. The thick furs and
darkly beautiful ornaments that decorate the walls make you
feel as if you're being watched. %t
%rf looks up from the conference
%g is having with the council of elders...&


#0000g
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and warm
furs that decorate the area.
Even though the sun outside is
bright and strong, winter's hand has
chilled you to the bone. You
find that you welcome the
well lit and warm interior.
Ahead of you waits %rf, %t of
%cn...&

You enter the audience
chamber of %t %rf of the %ct of
%cn, lips chapped from the cold,
flesh burned by the sun. Representatives from %cn2,
meeting with the %t, leave the
room as you enter. It appears
not to have gone well, for the
council of elders and %t %rf seem
to be in a sour mood...&

%t %rf's audience chamber is
alive with excitement. %cn and
%cn2, the %ct's neighbor to the
%di, are at %st talks. Naturally,
this has caused a lot of the
internal stress within %cn. The
%t is remarkably calm, hearing
each of the citizen's concerns
about trade and commerce...&


#0000h
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and warm
furs that decorate the area. The
chill in your bones quickly melts, and
you feel your limbs begin to
thaw in the warm heat of the
brightly lit interior. You
welcome the brief respite from
the cold. Ahead of you waits %rf,
%t of %cn...&

The audience chamber of %t
%rf is drier than the cold
streets of %cn, but not any
warmer. You rub your hands
together and watch your breath
come like smoke from a chimney...&

Your eyes, squinting from
the glare of the sun outside,
grow accustomed to the gloom of
%t %rf's audience chamber.&

#0000i
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and warm
furs that decorate the area. The freezing temperature and
iron gray clouds outside have made everything frozen and dull,
though you find that the
interior of this chamber is
brightly lit and cheerful. Ahead
of you waits %rf, %t of %cn...&

Frozen to the core, you
stumble into the audience
chamber of %t %rf, only to feel a
chill that pierces your soul.
The room itself is physically
warm and pleasing to the eye, but
you sense an undercurrent of tension...&

You are admitted into the
presence of the good %t of the
%ct of %cn. A thick cloak of
wolf hide is gently wrapped
around your shoulders, and as
feeling returns to your skin,
you feel that parts of your face
were dangerously close to
frostbite...&

#0000j
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and
expensive furniture that
decorate the area. The warm
spring air wafts through an open window,
bringing along with it the
scent of newly blooming cacti, and
fresh flowers.&

It is hard to believe that
anyone can think of politics on
such a day, but people are
lining up to be heard by %t %rf
while outside newly bloomed
flowers perfume the air...&

Inside the audience chamber
of %rf, %t of %cn, the new
sprouts of spring die young and
the perfume of the fresh blossom
turns to a sickly stench. %rf is rumored to have angered the %ct
oracle who placed upon the %t a
curse of poor health. The
political change has been very noticeable in such a %ct
where tradition is of highest
importance...&

#0000k
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and
expensive furniture that
decorate the area. The hot
spring shower has left you
pleasantly refreshed, if a bit
wet, but a hot breeze seems to be
blowing through here and you
feel yourself dry quickly...&

For an desert-based %ct
like %cn, a good spring rain
makes all the difference during
the seeding. Everyone seems in a
good mood, and the preparations
for the traditional new year celebrations is the
conversation on all lips...&

Through an open window in
the audience chamber of %t %rf,
you can smell the rare spring rain
and newly blossomed flowers out
in the streets of %cn. The floor
is wet with the tread of many visitors...&

#0000l
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and
expensive furniture that
decorate the area. The day has
been overcast, iron gray clouds
that hint of a spring storm. You
find yourself welcoming the
sun's return. Ahead of you waits
%rf, %t of %cn. It is well known
that %cn is currently at %st with
its neighbor, %cn2.&

The government of %cn is
like the weather outside,
hot and unforgiving. In the audience
chamber of %t %rf no one even
whispers their theories about
the ulterior motives behind the
%ct's recent declaration of %st
with its neighbor, %cn2.&

You like the looks of the
audience chamber of %rf, %t of
%cn the moment you enter.
Beautiful music rings through
the room and the walls hang with
rich tapestries of spring scenes
much nicer than the hot, gray day
outside...&

#0001a
You wipe the sweat off your
brow as you enter the Mages
Guild. The cool shade of the
interior is a welcomed sight
after standing under the harsh
summer sun. Around you are arcane implements and mystical
apparati. You can feel a slight tingling on your skin.&

For a moment after leaving
the bright summer sunshine, your
eyes register only darkness in the gloomy Mages Guild. When
they adjust, you can understand very
little of what you see. Tomes of antiquated wizardry and
obscure objects crowd the dusty shelves.&

The door to the Mages Guild
opens with a puff of dust that
sticks to the sweat on your
sunburned face. The smells of sulfurous potions burning and
ancient scrolls of moldering
parchment sting your nose. At least
it is cool in here, you say to yourself.&

#0001b
You shake the hot rain from your
shoulders as you enter the Mages Guild.
The dry interior is a
welcomed sight after standing in
the downpour outside. Around
you are arcane implements and
mystical apparati. You feel a
slight tingling on your skin.&

The sound of the brief summer
rain is muffled by the thick walls
and thicker velvet curtains. This
is a place where the outside world
is a distraction to be avoided.
The smells, sights, and sounds
here are unique to the field of mystical experimentation.&

You enter the Mages Guild,
avoiding the streams of water that
run unabsorbed by the parched desert
sands. The room is damp, but the thick
stone walls keep it cool even
in the dog days of summer. Strange devices and venerable
tomes crowd across the dust and soot streaked shelves.&

#0001c
You enter the Mages Guild,
its gloomy interior not much
different from the iron-gray,
overcast sky outside. At least,
you silently think, the sun isn't
out. Around you are arcane
implements and mystical apparati.
You feel a slight tingling on
your skin.&

All the humidity and heat of
the day are intensified in the
Mages Guild. To add to the
infernal atmosphere, tendrils of soot-filled smoke and the
whimpers from some doomed
experiment slip through the cracks
of locked doors. Each book on the shelf looks like it is
watching you.&

You enter the Mages Guild,
an amalgamation of primordial
relics, moldering scrolls, dripping unguents, and smoking
fluids. An occasional groan or minor
explosion can be heard coming
from the laboratories. At least
it's not as hot and humid as
outside.&

#0001d
Behind you the fall sun
sheds heat upon the land,
holding back the icy fingers of
winter yet another day. Around you
are arcane implements and
mystical apparati. You feel a
strange tingling on your skin.&

While the local farmers have
been gathering their crops, it
would appear the mages have been collecting
a harvest of their own. The
Mages Guild is crowded with scrolls, relics,
charms, and artifacts. Clearly
some extensive trading between one town's guild
to another's has been going
on.&

You enter the Mages Guild, a
world where nature holds
little power. Outside the sun beats the land with
heat, searing it clean. In here however,
strange flora lives year round, competing
for space next to the
scrolls, potions, and other
mystic apparati that crowds the
Guild's shelves.&

#0001e
You shake the hot rain from
your shoulders as you enter the
Mages Guild, stamping your feet
to wring out the excess water.
The dry interior is a welcomed
sight after standing in the uncommon
downpour outside. Around you are arcane implements and
mystical apparati. You can even feel a slight
tingling on your skin.&

The Mages Guild is dry, but
no more welcome that the hot
autumn tempest outside. Strange
and exotic potions, ancient
scrolls, and arcane relics
look down at you from the shelves
as if they are predatory birds, watching for you to make a
mistake. The dark energy in the
room goes through you like
an electrical charge.&

All along the walls of the Mages Guild,
blackened with soot and
neglect, are shelves of books
and arcane apparati so cloaked in
dust to be practically indistinguishable one from the
other. You can hear the sound of
the desert winds outside, uncomfortably loud in the normally
still little room.&

#0001f
You enter the Mage's Guild,
its gloomy interior not much
different from the cold, overcast
sky outside. At least, you
silently thank, the interior is
warm. You rub your hands together
to bring back some feeling.
Around you are arcane implements
and mystical apparati. You can feel a strange
tingling on your skin.&

On a dark cool day like
today, those who devote their
lives to the mystical sciences are
at their busiest. Outside,
people look into the sky and view
the coming winter with dread. All
in the Mages Guild are as
active with mystic energy as they might be on any day,
including the books and relics that line the shelves.&

You enter the Mages Guild,
going from a cool gloomy outside
to a cool gloomy inside. Because
of the shadows, you cannot see all that the chamber contains.
You suspect that even by the light
of a bright day, the room has its secrets. Potions, relics, and books
line the bookshelves shrouded by a fine dust.&

#0001g
The sun outside has done
little to warm your bones,
which are now almost frozen. You
enter the Mages Guild, stamping
your feet and crowding close to
a brazier that glows hot with
fiery coals. As the warmth slowly seeps in, you notice
arcane implements and mystical apparati.
You think you feel a strange
tingling on your skin.&

As sunny as it was, you felt
a winter chill outside and now,
within the Mages Guild, you feel
the cold more intensely. Dust
lies on the shelves of books,
potions, and relics like an early
frost. The stone walls of the
chamber glisten with ice.&

The melancholy Mages Guild
is slightly warmer than the winter
day outside but, without the
sunlight, the effect is much the
same. Many books and arcane instruments lie scattered about, but
they fail to lend any vitality to the scene. It is a place of
mystical study, not built
for human comfort.&

#0001h
Chill winds swirl about
you as you enter the Mages
Guild and shut the door. Outside
the winter's cold sets in without
any signs of stopping. You stamp
your feet and crowd close to a
brazier that glows hot with fiery coals. As the warmth
slowly seeps in, you notice arcane
implements and mystical apparati.
You think you feel a strange
tingling over your skin.&

The Mages Guild is so
omnipresent that all the arcane
relics within seem to be covered in
a thin shroud. It is an almost soundless chamber,
with only an occasional sigh from the pot of
boiling liquid on the fire. Slowly
warmth creeps back into your
chilled body.&

You enter the dim Mages
Guild, warmed by a spell that
brings life back into your chilled body
almost immediately.
Books, charms, scrolls, and other
relics, older than human memory,
are kept in pristine condition
here by the same mystic energy.&

#0001i
The gray sky has done little
to warm your bones, which by
now are almost frozen. You enter
the Mages Guild, stamping your
feet to increase the
circulation and crowd close to a brazier
that glows hot with
fiery coals. As the warmth slowly
seeps in, you notice arcane
implements and mystical apparati.
You think you feel a strange
tingling on your skin.&

It is a perfect day for
those who practice the shadowy
arts: the Mages Guild comes most
alive on cold, dark winter days.
Cauldrons bubble on the fireplace,
filling the room with translucent smoke
that smells of animal fat and
sulfur. The shelves are cluttered with
mystical books and artifacts...&

You know that you can only
see half of what is in the
Mages Guild. The titles of the
books on the shelves seem to
change depending on the angle you look.
Invisible fingers run
through the dust and over your face.
From the corner of your eye, you
can see demons grinning at you, but
they vanish when you turn to
look at them. As dark a winter day
as it is outside, you want to do
your business here and leave...&

#0001j
A cool breeze follows you
into the Mages Guild, drying the
slight sheen of sweat from
your brow. The interior smells of
spices and chemicals. As your
eyes adjust to the dim light you
can make out arcane implements
and mystical apparati. You think
you feel a strange tingling on your skin.&

You enter the Mages Guild,
the smell of sulfur and rotting parchment replacing
that of new cacti blossoms.
Scrolls and potions, relics and artifacts
vie for space on the bookshelves.
You can hear small living things scuttling behind the
volumes of alien encyclopedia.&

The mystical energy in the
Mages Guild runs through you
like a charge of lightning. Outside nature is in her full
vernal glory on this sunny day, but she has
little power in here. From the
stone walls to the scrolls and potions, the
 most mundane parts of
this chamber seem like phantasmagoria.&

#0001k
You shake the hot rain from
your shoulders, conscious of the pooling
water at your feet. As
your eyes slowly adjust to the dim interior you can make out
arcane implements and mystical apparati. You think you feel a
strange tingling on your skin.&

As thick as the stone walls
of the Mages guild are, you can
hear virtually every splatter of
the hot spring rain outside. You are almost
afraid to talk, for every echo of each footstep
causes great clouds of dust to billow. And
there are books and apparati in this
room, you suspect, that should
never be disturbed.&

An open window in the Mages
Guild lets in the smell of the
spring storm, which mingles with
the chemical stench that bubbles
from an open cauldron. The
chamber is filled with arcane
objects, jugs, cloaks, scrolls, amulets, tomes, brooches,
potions, robes, figurines, talismans.&

#0001l
Although the sky is gray the
weather itself is quite hot. You
can smell dry heat in the air, but that quickly changes as the
door shuts behind you. The Mages Guild
smells like old spices and
chemicals. You can make out dozens
of arcane implements and mystical apparati. You think you feel a
strange tingling on your skin.&

You enter the Mages Guild
from the gloomy spring day and are struck by the clutter.
You know that wizardry is a mental art, and
it is hard to believe the
sorcerers behind this jumble of
items and apparati are not either madmen or fools. You can
definitely hear small living things move about in the piles.&

The Mages Guild is not a
place where the normal gods of
Nature hold reign, but on such a
bleak spring day, it does not look like they have power
anywhere. Somehow the chamber is
simultaneously too hot and too
cold, wet with humidity in one
spot, drier than the desert
in another. Even the mystical items
on the shelves are juxtaposed
between extremes, ancient scrolls
next to modern measuring
devices, this one filthy with
neglect, that polished with care.&

#0002a
Cool shade and cooler drinks
greet you as you make your way
out of the heat and into the %nt,
smiling at the serving wench who
holds a mug of ale ready for the
first thirsty man...&

It is a relief to move
inside the %nt, away from the
burning summer heat, and you feel
that a cold mug of grog might
be in order...&

You enter the %nt, feeling
the cool shadows fall over your
face like a blanket...&

#0002b
You shake the rain from your
shoulders and enter the %nt,
hoping for a place where you can
at last rest and dry out...&

A burst of the warm summer
rain follows you into the %nt,
and you follow the many paths of
muddy footprints to the bar...&

Dripping from the summer
tempest outside, you enter the
%nt, relieved to have found shelter...&

#0002c
Although the sun isn't
shining, the humidity has
plastered your clothes to your back like a
second skin. As you close
the door to the %nt your eyes
search for a cool dark corner in
which to rest...&

It is uncomfortably hot and
sticky in the %nt, almost as bad
as the cloudy summer day
outside...&

You walk into the %nt from
the hot, cloudy day, welcomed
by the other patrons sequestered
away from the elements...&

#0002m
You are greeted by warm
laughter and merry talk as you
enter the %nt. Torches around the tavern
shed light on this warm summer night...&

The heat and humidity of the
day have disappeared, and it has turned
out to be a pleasantly cool night.
The torches on the walls of
the %nt light up many a sunburned face...&

The summer night is almost as
warm as the day had been, and you enter
the %nt craving something cold and wet...&

#0002d
You enter the %nt, heartened
by the smells of food and
spices, and prepare to relax in
the warm sunlight...&

The fiery autumn sun
disappears as you enter the %nt.
The sounds of laughter, clinking
glasses, and banging cooking
pans meet your ears...&

The townsmen have met in the
%nt to celebrate a good fall
harvest. Their exuberance is infectious.
Oh great, you say to yourself,
I'll probably have this stupid drinking
song in my head all day...&

#0002e
You enter the %nt and shake
the chill rain from your
shoulders, hoping for a fire of
some sort to dry yourself...&

Cold wind and rain follow
you into the %nt like a beggar.
You wipe your wet shoulders and
head as you head for the
fireplace...&

Shivering from the cold
autumn tempest, you escape
into the %nt. Other miserably wet
people have gathered in
dripping groups...&

#0002f
The %nt tavern you enter is
brightly lit and colorful,
compared to the cold, dark clouds
that hang in the sky...&

You walk out of the cloudy
autumn day into the %nt, the
smell of baking bread pulling on
you like a lure...&

On an overcast autumn day
like today, the %nt is very
popular and you can see why.
It certainly lifts the spirits...&

#0002o
You enter the %nt,
rubbing the chill night air from
your bones. The tavern is full of
people bustling here and there...&

On this cool autumn night,
the %nt seems especially
inviting. You smell apples baking
in the kitchen and look forward
to your first draught of ale...&

The warm smells of tobacco
smoke and simple foods draw you
into the %nt from the cold
autumn night...&

#0002g
You enter the %nt,
feeling the hearth fire slowly
chasing away the chill that has
crept into your bones from
this winter's day...&

It is a pleasant day for
winter, and the red-cheeked
townspeople in the %nt drink
their mulled wine to a toast
for a long hibernation...&

The winter sunlight shining
through the %nt windows does as
much as the roaring fireplace
to warm your chilled body...&

#0002h
You close the door on the
cold and rub your hands together,
warming them. Ahead of you the
innkeeper of the %nt hails you welcome,
holding a steaming mug of mulled wine...&

Great billows of wind
follow you into the %nt
like a shadow. The floor is
wet with the footprints of the patrons...&

Mulled wine is the featured
drink today in the %nt. You shake
the cold from your shoulders and
think that nothing could sound better...&

#0002i
The bright colors of the
interior of the %nt add life to
the otherwise gray day...&

You enter the %nt and your
frozen senses revive to the
smell of fresh baked bread and the sound of the patrons
laughing with the serving wench...&

The serving wench is passing
other patrons mugs of hot mulled
wine as you enter the %nt from
the cold, cloudy day...&

#0002p
You enter the %nt out of the cold winter
night, making your way closer to
the fire...&

The %nt seems to be the last
bastion of warmth and light
against the arctic darkness outside...&

Rubbing your hands briskly
together, you enter the %nt. The fireplace is so grand in
the room, in short time you feel almost too warm...&

#0002j
A cool breeze follows you
into the %nt, bringing with it
the smell of newly bloomed flowers
and fresh air...&

Through the open door and
windows, all the smells of
spring come into the %nt and the
chill of the winter
months fly out...&

You walk into the %nt,
immediately wishing you were again
out in the pleasant spring day...&

#0002k
You enter the %nt and wipe
your rain soaked head on a small
towel offered by the serving
wench. Outside the rare spring
shower continues...&

You are dripping wet as you
enter the %nt, but then again, so
are most of the rest of the
patrons. The bar wench is busily
passing out towels as well as drinks...&

You can still hear the
spring tempest outside, beating against the
walls of the %nt...&

#0002l
The %nt's colorful interior
adds life to the otherwise gray
spring day...&

Despite the rather cloudy
conditions outside, the atmosphere inside the %nt is
extremely lively. Someone could even get hurt...&

You leave the overcast
spring day and enter the %nt.
The smell of simple baked breads
coming from the kitchen seems
like an invitation to stay.&

#0002q
You enter the %nt, searching
for a clear table at which you
can relax on this warm spring
night...&

The %nt is like a
beacon in the cool spring
night, full of torch light,
clinking glasses, and the
aromas of the kitchen...&

It is a cool spring night
outside, but you have no need
to seek out the fireplace on
entering the %nt. The tobacco
smoke and smell of new bread
trickles out the open windows...&

#0003a
You enter the %tem, thankful
for the respite from the harsh
summer sun. You can hear
chanting in the distance...&

The stinging of prickly heat
is instantly soothed the moment
you enter the %tem sanctuary. In
the distance, you can hear the low
murmur of chanting. This is a
place of great tranquillity.&

The god who protects this
%tem must be great indeed, for it
is as bright as the summer day yet
comfortable as a shadowy place
within. A pleasant floral odor of
incense fills the air.&

#0003b
You enter the %tem, shaking
the rain off of yourself. You can
hear chanting in the distance...&

You enter the hallowed
ground of the %tem sanctuary, the sounds
of the summer rain mixing with that of
the chanting clergy. All your
tension, like the rare water, flows away.&

A fine mist, escaped from
the tempest outside, has
flooded the %tem sanctuary
bringing all the smells of summer
with it. You recognize the sing-song
prayer of the clergy as a plea for
a benevolent summer sun.&

#0003c
You enter the %tem, hoping
that your spirits can be lifted
on this gray, overcast day.
You can hear chanting in the
distance...&

As miserable as the
sweltering summer day is, it is
less eerie than the sterile
%tem sanctuary. No birds or
insects can be heard in here, and
the air is empty of both smell and temperature.
It may be very holy indeed, but you feel
like you have stepped into a void.&

The %tem sanctuary is a
haven for all, a place of self reflection,
solitude, and prayer. It is
always perfectly mild in
here, as hot and cloudy as the
day outside may be...&

#0003d
You enter the %tem and a
cool fall breeze follows you
into the hallowed halls. You can
hear chanting in the distance...&

The musty smell of autumn in
the outside air becomes mixed with
the spicy odor of incense as you
enter the %tem sanctuary...&

The stained glass windows in
the %tem sanctuary catch the
rays from the bright autumn sun
and transform them into crystalline fire.&

#0003e
You enter the warm %tem,
shaking the cold rain off of
yourself. You can hear chanting in
the distance...&

Wet from the autumn
thunderstorm, you enter the %tem, dripping. The warm smell of
incense begins to invigorate you, and in
the distance, you can hear the
%tem clergy at prayer.&

It is a place of peace, this
%tem sanctuary. Only by
concentrating on the world outside yourself can you hear the
vague drumbeat of the autumn
thunderstorm outside.&

#0003f
You enter the %tem, hoping
that your spirits can be lifted
on this cold, overcast day. You can hear chanting in the
distance...&

It is a miserable autumn
day, but within the %tem,
there is faith yet that the winter
may not be so deadly...&

Cold, dark clouds hang over
the %tem, but within you find,
all is bright and warm. Billowing
clouds of perfumed incense greet
the fog of your breath.&

#0003g
You enter the %tem, rubbing
your hands together to warm them
on this bright winter's day. You
can hear chanting in the
distance...&

The %tem sanctuary is as
austerely beautiful as the bright winter's day outside.
Tendrils of sweet incense rise from the floor
as if in greeting...&

On a day as cold as it is
blindingly bright, it is easy
to see why this part of the %tem
is called the sanctuary. Far off to the
distance, you can hear
the clergy at prayer.&

#0003h
You enter the %tem, shaking
the cold off of yourself and
stamping your feet to warm them.
You can hear chanting in the distance...&

Brushing the cold off you walk
into the %tem sanctuary. The smell
of incense strikes you immediately;
spicy and somewhat sweet...&

You trail some cold into the
%tem sanctuary as you enter. The
air is as cold as the outdoors,
yet filled with the smell of
incense and the sound of the
clergy praying...&

#0003i
You enter the %tem, rubbing
your hands to warm them and
hoping that your spirits can be
lifted on this cold, overcast day.
You can hear chanting in the distance...&

Already you can feel the
power of the %tem sanctuary,
thawing your frigid body,
brightening your spirits which
have grown dark as the cloud
filled sky...&

Strange sounds and smells
meet you as you leave the cold,
cloudy winter's day: the incense's
bittersweet aroma is new to
your senses and the %tem clergy 
sing solemnly in a language dead
for many eons...&

#0003j
You enter the %tem and a
cool spring breeze follows you,
bringing with it the smell of
fresh blooms. You can hear chanting in
the distance...&

It is bright and fresh in
the %tem sanctuary as the spring
day outside. In the distance, you
can hear the chanting of the
clergy.&

The smell of the new
blossoms of spring that came into
the %tem sanctuary with you mixes
with the slightly spicy smell of incense.
You can hear the clergy far
away, giving a pray of thanksgiving for
the beauty of the new year.&

#0003k
You enter the %tem, shaking
the warm rain off of yourself.
You can hear chanting in the distance...&

Trailing puddles of warm
spring rain behind you, you enter
the %tem sanctuary. An open
window lets the smell of the storm
in, overpowering the sweet
incense of the %tem itself.&

Wiping the warm rain from
your shoulders and head, you walk
into the %tem sanctuary. Off to
the distance, you can hear the
clergy, prayer in a sing-song
for a good planting season for the farmers...&

#0003l
You enter the %tem wishing
that the sun would return and make
the day a truly pleasant one.
You can hear chanting in the distance...&

You walk into the %tem,
smelling the sweet incense that
rises like a cloud from the
sanctuary floor. In the distance,
you hear the clergy praying
for a return of the sun to this
dreary spring day...&

You enter the %tem, gray as
this spring day sky. Almost immediately the bittersweet
smell of the incense strengthens your spirit.
The clergy drone their prayers far off in the distance.&

#0004a
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the summer heat. Many
items of interest hang on the walls and in the
display case in front of you...&

The interior of %en is neat
and well organized. You wipe
the sweat from your brow and look
over the weapons and gear...&

It is a relief to enter the
%en, out of the infernal
summer sunshine. Various supplies
are carefully arranged
throughout the store for your
browsing convenience...&

#0004b
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the summer rain. The cool
shade causes shivers to run over
your damp body. Many items of
interest hang on the walls and
in the display
case in front of you...&

The interior of %en is
spotlessly clean and neat. You
feel almost embarrassed to be
dripping puddles of warm rain
water all over as you glance
over the gear and weapon
displays...&

Wiping the warm water from
the summer shower off your head,
you enter %en. A display case
of the more popular supplies is featured in the small room.&

#0004c
You walk into %en. Many
items of interest hang on the
walls and in the
display case in front of you...&

%en is a refuge from the
steamy summer day. In the
display case and all along the
walls are supplies and weaponry
for sale...&

You enter %en from the
overcast summer day. You browse
over the items displayed throughout
the store and are impressed by the variety...&

#0004d
As you enter %en, golden
glints from the fall sun
reflect off of the many items
of interest scattered about...&

You enter %en from the sunny
autumn day. Cases of weaponry
are featured next to some of the
more peaceful supplies and gear...&

The pleasant autumn weather
has given %en an air of
joviality. You browse through
cases and displays of various supplies...&

#0004e
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the cold shower. As you dry
off you notice the many items of interest that hang on the
walls and in the display
case in front of you...&

You are handed a towel as
you come into %en from the
autumn thunderstorm. There is a
new shipment of weaponry and other gear,
and you notice several pieces worth
looking at...&

You are dripping with cold
rain water as you enter %en. It
is a neat and clean chamber with
a wide assortment of supplies and
weapons...&

#0004f
You enter %en rubbing your
hands together to warm them from
the chill. Many items of
interest hang on the walls and are
displayed in the display case in front of
you...&

It is a miserable autumn day
outside, and it is good to get
inside %en. You glance over the
new shipments of supplies and weaponry.&

It is a bit early in the
year for this sort of chilling weather,
but new supplies of gear
and armaments arrived at %en
with the cold. You find a few
useful items immediately...&

#0004g
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the cold and bright
winter's day. Many items of
interest hang on the walls and
in the display
case in front of you...&

%en is as bright as the
winter day outside and much
warmer. Several pieces of weaponry
and equipment look interesting
to you...&

You walk into %en, rubbing
your numb hands together. At least
it is sunny outside. Many new
weapons and supplies impress
you enough for a closer
look...&

#0004h
You enter %en, stamping your
feet to warm them and shaking
the frozen cold from your
shoulders. Many items of interest
hang on the walls and are
displayed in the display case in
front of you...&

A warm fire in %en thaws
your frozen body. You notice several
supplies in the display case and along
the walls that just might be useful...&

You let a spray of cold and
wind into %en as you enter.
Still, with the exception of the puddle by the door, the
chamber is neat and tidy. The walls and
display cases are fully stocked
with all varieties of weaponry and supplies...&

#0004i
You enter %en. Outside the
sun is hidden behind a thick
gray layer of clouds, dropping the temperature and making your
body steam in the warmth of the shopkeeper's hearth. Many items of
interest hang on the walls and
in the display
case in front of you...&

You are quickly given a cup
of hot cider as you enter %en,
which you accept gratefully, happy
to be inside on such a gloomy
winter's day. You look over the weaponry and other
merchandise proudly displayed in a case and all along the walls.&

The dog days of winter are
certainly here. You enter %en,
hoping for a deal or two on a
couple essential pieces of
equipment. Several things
immediately attract your attention
as you look over the display
case and the assortments along
the walls...&

#0004j
You enter %en and bring with
you a cool spring breeze that
ruffles many of the items of
interest hanging on the walls.
There are more items displayed in
the display case in front of
you...&

It is a beautiful spring day
outside, and the mood of the
clerks in %en is bright. Perhaps
you can get a good deal off
them on a couple of items that
impress you...&

An open window in %en brings
in the smell of spring flowers
as you look over your money to
see what you can afford. There are several displayed items
that might prove useful...&

#0004k
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the cool spring shower.
Many items of interest hang on
the walls and in the display case in front of
you...&

It looks like a new shipment
of weaponry and other supplies
arrived in %en at the same time
the rain picked up outside. You
notice several items of interest...&

You wipe the cool spring
rain from your shoulders and head
as you enter %en. Most of the
items within are meant more for the townsmen
than you, but you do see some
adventuring equipment...&

#0004l
You enter %en, hoping that
the sun will show itself again.
There are many items of interest hanging
on the walls and displayed in the
display case in front
of you...&

There is a window open in
%en: the clerks are apparently
hoping for some fresh scents of
spring cacti to brighten a gray day.
Several weapons and supplies on
display might be helpful to you...&

It is a cold and overcast
day, and you doubt that the clerks
in %en are in the mood to barter.
You check your money supply as
you browse through the store's
wares...&


#0000a
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
fine trappings and furniture
that decorate the area. A cold
breeze wafts through the area,
chilling the sweat from your body
and bringing a unpleasant sigh to
your lips. You relish at the idea of
a brief respite. Ahead of you
waits %rf, %t of %cn. It is well
known that %cn is currently at %st with its
neighbor, %cn2.&

Outside the wind batters
relentlessly on the citizens of
%cn, but in the audience chamber
of %rf, %t of the %ct, the
walls are deliverance. The
rewards of power and wealth
decorate the room. Obviously,
being at %st with the %ct's
neighbor, %cn2, has been
profitable for the %t of %cn.
Perhaps you too can benefit from
this situation...&

You enter the audience
chamber of %rf, %t of %cn.
Despite the season, not a
ray of sunshine has touched this
room. You breath in the musty
air and wipe the sweat from your
brow as you wait for the %t to
finish business with some
messengers from %cn2, %cn's
neighbor. The behavior between
the %t and the messengers is
peculiar, considering the two
have been at %st for some time...&

#0000b
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
fine trappings and furniture
that decorate the area. Outside
you can still hear the raindrops
as they fall, soaking everything
in sight and creating a humid
haze which causes your clothes
to cling to you like a second
skin. Ahead of you waits %rf, %t
of %cn. It is well known that
%cn is currently at %st with its neighbor, %cn2.&

You enter the audience
chamber, wiping the sweat
from the warm air off of your
face. At the center of the
opulently decorated room, %t %rf
is speaking with the %ct
councilmen of %cn. You overhear
them mention %cn2, their
neighbor to the %di, with which
%cn is at %st.&

Like an unwanted dog, the
dry chill from the cold summer
has followed you to the audience chamber of %rf, %t of
%cn. They whisper,
but you think you hear one of
the counselors remind the %t
that they are at %st with %cn2, the
%ct's neighbor to the %di.&

#0000c
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
fine trappings and furniture
that decorate the area. Even
though the clouds outside have
made everything seem dull and
gray, you find that the interior
is brightly lit and cheerful.
Ahead of you waits %rf, %t of
%cn. It is well known that %cn
is currently at %st with its
neighbor, %cn2.&

You enter %t %rf's audience
chamber, finding the %ct elders
in conference with the %t. The
mood in the room reflects the
weather outside; cold and dark
with gray clouds. The elders
continue to whisper nervously
one to the other.&

The audience chamber of %t
%rf of %cn is alive with
activity. The %t and an elder
discuss a discontented local
group who wish %cn no longer to
be at %st with its neighbor,
%cn %g next turns attention to
a merchant whose shop is under suspicion of housing a
Thieves' Guild...&

#0000d
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and
furniture that decorate the
area. Outside the golden fall
sun does nothing to lend its heat
to the interior.
Ahead of you waits
%rf, %t of %cn. It is well known
that %cn is currently at %st with
its neighbor, %cn2.&

It is the busiest season of
the year in %cn, and the
palace's audience chamber is
filled with area townsmen
discussing the upcoming winter's
weather with %t %rf. Many linger in the room
after their business is through,
procrastinating the return to the chill
winds outside. They seem to be talking mostly about
%cn being suddenly at %st with its nearest neighbor,
%cn2, and how this will
change the trade throughout the province.&

It is unusually warm for the
autumn in %cn, but the audience chamber of %t %rf
reflects little of the sun's heat outside...&

#0000e
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber shaking the
cold rain from your shoulders.
The first thing you notice is
the many fine trappings and
furniture that decorate the
area. The arctic air serves to
quickly chill you. Ahead of you
waits %rf, %t of %cn...&

You had hoped that the
chamber of the %t of %cn would
provide relief from the cold
autumn rain outside, but it is
as damp and chilly as a
mausoleum. Others seeking
audience wait with dripping hair
and chattering teeth, as %t %rf
talks with a representative from
%cn2, the %ct's neighbor that
%cn is at %st with...&

It has been an uncomfortably
cold autumn in the %ct of %cn,
so the recent shower has
destroyed the mood in
the audience chamber of %t %rf.
You know that %cn2, %cn's temperamental neighbor, is only
recently at %st with %t %rf, but
foreign diplomacy is not being discussed among the %t and the
circle of counselors.&

#0000f
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and furs
that decorate the area. Even
though autumn's clouds outside
have made everything seem dark
and gray, you find that the
interior is brightly lit and
warm. Ahead of you waits %rf, %t
of %cn. It is well known that
%cn is currently at %st with its neighbor, %cn2.&

You enter %t %rf's audience
chamber, shaking the chill of
the gray autumn day from your
skin. Being currently at %st with
its neighbor %cn2, the leading citizens of %cn have met to
discuss the resultant implications with their %t...&

As you enter the audience
chamber of the %t of %cn, you
feel the autumn chill from the
outside is actually intensified within. The thick furs and
darkly beautiful ornaments that decorate the walls make you
feel as if you're being watched...&


#0000g
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and warm
furs that decorate the area.
Even though the sun outside is
bright and strong, winter's hand has
chilled you to the bone. You
find that you welcome the
well lit and warm interior.
Ahead of you waits %rf, %t of
%cn...&

You enter the audience
chamber of %t %rf of the %ct of
%cn, lips chapped from the cold,
flesh burned by the sun. Representatives from %cn2,
meeting with the %t, leave the
room as you enter. It appears
not to have gone well, for the
council of elders and %t %rf seem
to be in a sour mood...&

%t %rf's audience chamber is
alive with excitement. %cn and
%cn2, the %ct's neighbor to the
%di, are at %st talks. Naturally,
this has caused a lot of the
internal stress within %cn. The
%t is remarkably calm, hearing
each of the citizen's concerns
about trade and commerce...&


#0000h
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and warm
furs that decorate the area. The
chill in your bones quickly thaws, and
you feel your limbs begin to
heat in the warmth of the
brightly lit interior. You
welcome the brief respite from
the cold. Ahead of you waits %rf,
%t of %cn...&

The audience chamber of %t
%rf is drier than the cold
streets of %cn, but not any
warmer. You rub your hands
together and watch your breath
come like smoke from a chimney...&

Your eyes, squinting from
the glare of the sun outside,
grow accustomed to the gloom of
%t %rf's audience chamber.&

#0000i
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and warm
furs that decorate the area. The freezing temperature and
iron gray clouds outside have made everything frozen and dull,
though you find that the
interior of this chamber is
brightly lit and cheerful. Ahead
of you waits %rf, %t of %cn...&

Frozen to the core, you
stumble into the audience
chamber of %t %rf, only to feel a
chill that pierces your soul.
The room itself is physically
warm and pleasing to the eye, but
you sense an undercurrent of tension...&

You are admitted into the
presence of the good %t of the
%ct of %cn. A thick cloak of
wolf hide is gently wrapped
around your shoulders, and as
feeling returns to your skin,
you feel that parts of your face
were dangerously close to
frostbite...&

#0000j
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and
expensive furniture that
decorate the area. The cool
spring air wafts through an open window,
bringing along with it the
scent of some fresh flowers.&

It is hard to believe that
anyone can think of politics on
such a day, but people are
lining up to be heard by %t %rf
while outside newly bloomed
flowers perfume the air...&

Inside the audience chamber
of %rf, %t of %cn, the new
sprouts of spring die young and
the perfume of the fresh blossom
turns to a sickly stench. %rf is rumored
to have angered the %ct
oracle who placed upon the %t a
curse of poor health. The
political change has been very noticeable in such a %ct
where tradition is of highest
importance...&

#0000k
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and
expensive furniture that
decorate the area. The cold
spring shower has left you
invigorated, but a bit
wet. A warmer breeze seems to be
blowing through here and you
feel yourself dry quickly...&

For an arctic-based %ct
like %cn, a good spring sun
makes all the difference during
this season. Everyone seems in a
good mood, and the preparations
for the traditional new year celebrations is the
conversation on all lips...&

Through an open window in
the audience chamber of %t %rf,
you can feel the rare spring warmth
and newly blossomed flowers out
in the streets of %cn. The floor
is wet with the tread of many visitors...&

#0000l
You walk into the %t's
audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and
expensive furniture that
decorate the area. The day has
been overcast, iron gray clouds
that hint of a spring storm. You
find yourself welcoming the
sun's return. Ahead of you waits
%rf, %t of %cn. It is well known
that %cn is currently at %st with
its neighbor, %cn2.&

The government of %cn is
like the weather outside,
cold and unforgiving. In the audience
chamber of %t %rf no one even
whispers their theories about
the ulterior motives behind the
%ct's recent declaration of %st
with its neighbor, %cn2.&

You like the looks of the
audience chamber of %rf, %t of
%cn the moment you enter.
Beautiful music rings through
the room and the walls hang with
rich tapestries of spring scenes
much nicer than the cold, gray day
outside...&

#0001a
You enter the Mages
Guild, happy to be out of the chill.
The interior is a welcomed sight
after standing in the harsh
summer air. Around you are arcane
implements and mystical
apparati. You can feel a slight
tingling on your skin.&

For a moment after leaving
the bright summer sunshine, your
eyes register only darkness in the gloomy Mages Guild. When
they adjust, you can understand very
little of what you see. Tomes of antiquated wizardry and
obscure objects crowd the dusty shelves.&

The door to the Mages Guild
opens with a puff of dust that
sticks to the sweat on your
sunburned face. The smells of
sulfurous potions burning and
ancient scrolls of moldering
parchment sting your nose. At least
it is warm in here, you say to yourself.&

#0001b
You shake the cold rain from your
shoulders as you enter the Mages Guild.
The dry interior is a
welcomed sight after standing in
the downpour outside. Around
you are arcane implements and
mystical apparati. You feel a
slight tingling on your skin.&

The sound of the brief summer
rain is muffled by the thick walls
and thicker velvet curtains. This
is a place where the outside world
is a distraction to be avoided.
The smells, sights, and sounds
here are unique to the field of mystical experimentation.&

You enter the Mages Guild,
avoiding the streams of water that
run melted by the warm Guild air.
The room is damp, but the thick
stone walls keep it cool even
in the dog days of summer. Strange devices and venerable
tomes crowd across the dust and soot streaked shelves.&

#0001c
You enter the Mages Guild,
its gloomy interior not much
different from the iron-gray,
overcast sky outside. At least,
you silently think, the snow isn't
falling. Around you are arcane
implements and mystical apparati.
You feel a slight tingling on
your skin.&

All the cold and chill of
the day are intensified in the
Mages Guild. To add to the
frigid atmosphere, tendrils of
soot-filled smoke and the
whimpers from some doomed
experiment slip through the cracks
of locked doors. Each book on the
shelf looks like it is watching you.&

You enter the Mages Guild,
an amalgamation of primordial
relics, moldering scrolls,
dripping unguents, and smoking
fluids. An occasional groan or minor
explosion can be heard coming
from the laboratories. At least
it's not as cold and windy as
outside.&

#0001d
Behind you the fall sun
sheds little heat upon the land,
welcoming the icy fingers of
winter yet another day. Around you
are arcane implements and
mystical apparati. You feel a
strange tingling on your skin.&

While the local farmers have
been gathering their crops, it
would appear the mages have been collecting
a harvest of their own. The
Mages Guild is crowded with scrolls, relics,
charms, and artifacts. Clearly
some extensive trading between one town's guild
to another's has been going on.&

You enter the Mages Guild, a
world where nature holds
little power. Outside the sun fights a
losing battle against the cold. In here however,
strange flora lives year round, competing
for space next to the
scrolls, potions, and other
mystic apparati that crowds the
Guild's shelves.&

#0001e
You shake the cold rain from
your shoulders as you enter the
Mages Guild, stamping your feet
to wring out the excess water.
The dry interior is a welcomed
sight after standing in the cold
downpour outside. Around you are arcane implements and
mystical apparati. You can even feel a slight
tingling on your skin.&

The Mages Guild is dry, but
no more welcome that the cold
autumn tempest outside. Strange
and exotic potions, ancient
scrolls, and arcane relics
look down at you from the shelves
as if they are predatory birds,
watching for you to make a
mistake. The dark energy in the
room goes through you like
an electrical charge.&

All along the walls of the Mages Guild,
blackened with soot and
neglect, are shelves of books
and arcane apparati so cloaked in
dust to be practically indistinguishable
one from the other. You can hear the
sound of the arctic winds outside,
uncomfortably loud in the normally
still little room.&

#0001f
You enter the Mage's Guild,
its gloomy interior not much
different from the cold, overcast
sky outside. At least, you
silently thank, the interior is
warm. You rub your hands together
to bring back some feeling.
Around you are arcane implements
and mystical apparati. You can feel a strange
tingling on your skin.&

On a dark cool day like
today, those who devote their
lives to the mystical sciences are
at their busiest. Outside,
people look into the sky and view
the coming winter with dread. All
in the Mages Guild are as
active with mystic energy as they might be on any day,
including the books and relics that line the shelves.&

You enter the Mages Guild,
going from a cool gloomy outside
to a cool gloomy inside. Because
of the shadows, you cannot see all that the chamber contains.
You suspect that even by the light
of a bright day, the room has its secrets. Potions, relics, and books
line the bookshelves shrouded by a fine dust.&

#0001g
The sun outside has done
little to warm your bones,
which are now almost frozen. You
enter the Mages Guild, stamping
your feet and crowding close to
a brazier that glows hot with
fiery coals. As the warmth slowly
seeps in, you notice
arcane implements and mystical apparati.
You think you feel a strange
tingling on your skin.&

Although the sun was out, you felt
a winter's chill outside and now,
within the Mages Guild, you feel
the cold more intensely. Dust
lies on the shelves of books,
potions, and relics like an early
frost. The stone walls of the
chamber glisten with ice.&

The melancholy Mages Guild
is slightly warmer than the winter
day outside but, without the
sunlight, the effect is much the
same. Many books and arcane instruments
lie scattered about, but
they fail to lend any vitality to
the scene. It is a place of
mystical study, not built
for human comfort.&

#0001h
Chill winds swirl about
you as you enter the Mages
Guild and shut the door. Outside
the winter's cold sets in without
any signs of stopping. You stamp
your feet and crowd close to a
brazier that glows hot with
fiery coals. As the warmth
slowly seeps in, you notice arcane
implements and mystical apparati.
You think you feel a strange
tingling over your skin.&

The Mages Guild is so
omnipresent that all the arcane
relics within seem to be covered in
a thin shroud. It is an almost
soundless chamber,
with only an occasional sigh from the pot of
boiling liquid on the fire. Slowly
warmth creeps back into your
chilled body.&

You enter the dim Mages
Guild, warmed by a spell that
brings life back into your chilled body
almost immediately.
Books, charms, scrolls, and other
relics, older than human memory,
are kept in pristine condition
here by the same mystic energy.&

#0001i
The gray sky has done little
to warm your bones, which by
now are almost frozen. You enter
the Mages Guild, stamping your
feet to increase the
circulation and crowd close to a brazier
that glows hot with
fiery coals. As the warmth slowly
seeps in, you notice arcane
implements and mystical apparati.
You think you feel a strange
tingling on your skin.&

It is a perfect day for
those who practice the shadowy
arts: the Mages Guild comes most
alive on cold, dark winter days.
Cauldrons bubble on the fireplace,
filling the room with translucent smoke
that smells of animal fat and
sulfur. The shelves are cluttered with
mystical books and artifacts...&

You know that you can only
see half of what is in the
Mages Guild. The titles of the
books on the shelves seem to
change depending on the angle you look.
Invisible fingers run
through the dust and over your face.
From the corner of your eye, you
can see demons grinning at you, but
they vanish when you turn to
look at them. As dark a winter day
as it is outside, you want to do
your business here and leave...&

#0001j
A chill breeze follows you
into the Mages Guild, drying the
slight sheen of sweat from
your brow. The interior smells of
spices and chemicals. As your
eyes adjust to the dim light you
can make out arcane implements
and mystical apparati. You think
you feel a strange tingling on your skin.&

You enter the Mages Guild,
the smell of sulfur and rotting parchment replacing
that of new blossoms.
Scrolls and potions, relics and artifacts
vie for space on the bookshelves.
You can hear small living things scuttling behind the
volumes of alien encyclopedia.&

The mystical energy in the
Mages Guild runs through you
like a charge of lightning. Outside nature
is in her full arctic glory,
but she has little power in here. From the
stone walls to the scrolls and potions, the
most mundane parts of this chamber seem like phantasmagoria.&

#0001k
You shake the cold rain from
your shoulders, conscious of the pooling
water at your feet. As your eyes slowly adjust
to the dim interior you can make out
arcane implements and mystical apparati. You think you feel a
strange tingling on your skin.&

As thick as the stone walls
of the Mages guild are, you can
hear virtually every splatter of
the cold rain outside. You are almost
afraid to talk, for every echo of each footstep
causes great clouds of dust to billow. And
there are books and apparati in this
room, you suspect, that should
never be disturbed.&

An open window in the Mages
Guild lets in the smell of the
spring storm, which mingles with
the chemical stench that bubbles
from an open cauldron. The
chamber is filled with arcane
objects, jugs, cloaks, scrolls, amulets, tomes, brooches,
potions, robes, figurines, talismans.&

#0001l
Although the sky is gray the
weather itself is quite cold. You
can smell dry chill in the air, but
that quickly changes as the
door shuts behind you. The Mages Guild
smells like old spices and
chemicals. You can make out dozens
of arcane implements and mystical apparati.&

You enter the Mages Guild
from the gloomy spring day and
are struck by the clutter.
You know that wizardry is a mental
art. It is hard to believe the
sorcerers behind this jumble of
items and apparati are not either
madmen or fools. You can
definitely hear small living things
move about in the piles.&

The Mages Guild is not a
place where the normal gods of
Nature hold reign, but on such a
bleak spring day, it does not look
like they have power
anywhere. Somehow the chamber is
simultaneously too cold and too
hot, wet with humidity in one
spot, drier than the desert
in another. Even the mystical items
on the shelves are juxtaposed
between extremes, ancient scrolls
next to modern measuring
devices, this one filthy with
neglect, that polished with care.&

#0002a
Warm shade and warmer drinks
greet you as you make your way
out of the chill and into the %nt,
smiling at the serving wench who
holds a mug of ale ready for the
first thirsty man...&

It is a relief to move
inside the %nt, away from the
chilling summer air, and you feel
that a mug of grog might
be in order...&

You enter the %nt, feeling
the shadows fall over your
face like a blanket...&

#0002b
You shake the rain from your
shoulders and enter the %nt,
hoping for a place where you can
at last rest and dry out...&

A burst of the cold summer
rain follows you into the %nt,
and you follow the many paths of
muddy footprints to the bar...&

Dripping from the cold summer
tempest outside, you enter the
%nt, relieved to have found shelter...&

#0002c
Although the sun isn't
shining, the chill has
frozen your clothes to your back like a
second skin. As you close
the door to the %nt your eyes
search for a warm dark corner in
which to rest...&

It is uncomfortably cold and
dry in the %nt, almost as bad
as the chilly summer day
outside...&

You walk into the %nt from
the cold, cloudy day, welcomed
by the other patrons sequestered
away from the elements...&

#0002m
You are greeted by warm
laughter and merry talk as you
enter the %nt. Torches around the tavern
shed light on this cold summer night...&

The wind and chill of the
day have disappeared, and it has turned
out to be a pleasantly cool night.
The torches on the walls of
the %nt light up many a face...&

The summer night is colder than
the day had been, and you enter
the %nt craving something warm and dry...&

#0002d
You enter the %nt, heartened
by the smells of food and
spices, and prepare to relax in
the warm sunlight...&

The fiery autumn sun
disappears as you enter the %nt.
The sounds of laughter, clinking
glasses, and banging cooking
pans meet your ears...&

The townsmen have met in the
%nt to celebrate a good summer
season. Their exuberance is infectious.
Oh great, you say to yourself,
I'll probably have this stupid drinking
song in my head all day...&

#0002e
You enter the %nt and shake
the chill rain from your
shoulders, hoping for a fire of
some sort to dry yourself...&

Cold wind and rain follow
you into the %nt like a beggar.
You wipe your wet shoulders and
head as you head for the
fireplace...&

Shivering from the cold
autumn tempest, you escape
into the %nt. Other miserably wet
people have gathered in
dripping groups...&

#0002f
The %nt tavern you enter is
brightly lit and colorful,
compared to the cold, dark clouds
that hang in the sky...&

You walk out of the cloudy
autumn day into the %nt, the
smell of baking bread pulling on
you like a lure...&

On an overcast autumn day
like today, the %nt is very
popular and you can see why.
It certainly lifts the spirits...&

#0002o
You enter the %nt,
rubbing the chill night air from
your bones. The tavern is full of
people bustling here and there...&

On this freezing autumn night,
the %nt seems especially
inviting. You smell apples baking
in the kitchen and look forward
to your first draught of ale...&

The warm smells of tobacco
smoke and simple foods draw you
into the %nt from the freezing
autumn night...&

#0002g
You enter the %nt,
feeling the hearth fire slowly
chasing away the chill that has
crept into your bones from
this winter's day...&

It is a freezing day, and the red-cheeked
townspeople in the %nt drink
their mulled wine to a toast
for a long hibernation...&

The winter sunlight shining
through the %nt windows helps little
compared to the roaring fireplace
to warm your chilled body...&

#0002h
You close the door on the
cold and rub your hands together,
warming them. Ahead of you the
innkeeper of the %nt hails you welcome,
holding a steaming mug of mulled wine...&

Great billows of wind
follow you into the %nt
like a shadow. The floor is
wet with the footprints of the patrons...&

Mulled wine is the featured
drink today in the %nt. You shake
the cold from your shoulders and
think that nothing could sound better...&

#0002i
The bright colors of the
interior of the %nt add life to
the otherwise gray day...&

You enter the %nt and your
frozen senses revive to the
smell of fresh baked bread and the sound of the patrons
laughing with the serving wench...&

The serving wench is passing
other patrons mugs of warmed mulled
wine as you enter the %nt from
the cold, cloudy day...&

#0002p
You enter the %nt out of the frozen winter
night, making your way closer to
the fire...&

The %nt seems to be the last
bastion of warmth and light
against the arctic darkness outside...&

Rubbing your hands briskly
together, you enter the %nt. The fireplace is so grand in
the room, in short time you feel almost too warm...&

#0002j
The chill breath of spring follows you
into the %nt, bringing with it
the smell of bloomed flowers
and ice fresh air...&

Through the open door and
windows, all the smells of
spring come into the %nt and the
freeze of the winter
months fly out...&

You walk into the %nt,
immediately wishing you were again
out in the cool spring day...&

#0002k
You enter the %nt and wipe
your rain soaked head on a small
towel offered by the serving
wench. Outside the rare spring
shower continues...&

You are dripping wet as you
enter the %nt, but then again, so
are most of the rest of the
patrons. The bar wench is busily
passing out towels as well as drinks...&

You can still hear the
spring tempest outside, beating against the
walls of the %nt...&

#0002l
The %nt's colorful interior
adds life to the otherwise gray
spring day...&

Despite the rather cloudy
conditions outside, the atmosphere inside the %nt is
extremely lively. Someone could even get hurt...&

You leave the overcast
spring day and enter the %nt.
The smell of simple baked breads
coming from the kitchen seems
like an invitation to stay.&

#0002q
You enter the %nt, searching
for a clear table at which you
can relax on this cool spring
night...&

The %nt is like a
beacon in the cool spring
night, full of torch light,
clinking glasses, and the
aromas of the kitchen...&

It is a cool spring night
outside, but you have no need
to seek out the fireplace on
entering the %nt. The tobacco
smoke and smell of new bread
trickles out the open windows...&

#0003a
You enter the %tem, thankful
for the respite from the harsh
summer sun and cold winds. You can hear
chanting in the distance...&

The stinging of prickly heat
is instantly soothed the moment
you enter the %tem sanctuary. In
the distance, you can hear the low
murmur of chanting. This is a
place of great tranquillity.&

The god who protects this
%tem must be great indeed, for it
is as bright as the summer day yet
comfortable as a shadowy place
within. A pleasant floral odor of
incense fills the air.&

#0003b
You enter the %tem, shaking
the rain off of yourself. You can
hear chanting in the distance...&

You enter the hallowed
ground of the %tem sanctuary, the sounds
of the summer rain mixing with that of
the chanting clergy. All your
tension, like the water, flows away.&

A fine mist, escaped from
the tempest outside, has
flooded the %tem sanctuary
bringing all the smells of summer
with it. You recognize the sing-song
prayer of the clergy as a plea for
a benevolent winter sun.&

#0003c
You enter the %tem, hoping
that your spirits can be lifted
on this gray, overcast day.
You can hear chanting in the
distance...&

As miserable as the
summer day is, it is
less eerie than the sterile
%tem sanctuary. No birds or
insects can be heard in here, and
the air is empty of both smell and temperature.
It may be very holy indeed, but you feel
like you have stepped into a void.&

The %tem sanctuary is a
haven for all, a place of self reflection,
solitude, and prayer. It is
always perfectly mild in
here, as cold and cloudy as the
day outside may be...&

#0003d
You enter the %tem and a
chill fall breeze follows you
into the hallowed halls. You can
hear chanting in the distance...&

The musty smell of autumn in
the outside air becomes mixed with
the spicy odor of incense as you
enter the %tem sanctuary...&

The stained glass windows in
the %tem sanctuary catch the
rays from the bright autumn sun
and transform them into crystalline fire.&

#0003e
You enter the warm %tem,
shaking the cold rain off of
yourself. You can hear chanting in
the distance...&

Wet from the autumn
thunderstorm, you enter the %tem, dripping.
The warm smell of
incense begins to invigorate you, and in
the distance, you can hear the
%tem clergy at prayer.&

It is a place of peace, this
%tem sanctuary. Only by
concentrating on the world outside
yourself can you hear the
vague drumbeat of the autumn
thunderstorm outside.&

#0003f
You enter the %tem, hoping
that your spirits can be lifted
on this cold, overcast day.
You can hear chanting in the
distance...&

It is a miserable autumn
day, but within the %tem,
there is faith yet that the winter
may not be so deadly...&

Cold, dark clouds hang over
the %tem, but within you find,
all is bright and warm. Billowing
clouds of perfumed incense greet
the fog of your breath.&

#0003g
You enter the %tem, rubbing
your hands together to warm them
on this frozen winter's day. You
can hear chanting in the
distance...&

The %tem sanctuary is as
austerely beautiful as the
bright winter's day outside.
Tendrils of sweet incense rise
from the floor as if in greeting...&

On a day as cold as it is
blindingly bright, it is easy
to see why this part of the %tem
is called the sanctuary. Far off to the
distance, you can hear
the clergy at prayer.&

#0003h
You enter the %tem, shaking
the cold off of yourself and
stamping your feet to warm them.
You can hear chanting in the distance...&

Brushing the cold off you walk
into the %tem sanctuary. The smell
of incense strikes you immediately;
spicy and somewhat sweet...&

You trail some cold into the
%tem sanctuary as you enter. The
air is as cold as the outdoors,
yet filled with the smell of
incense and the sound of the
clergy praying...&

#0003i
You enter the %tem, rubbing
your hands to warm them and
hoping that your spirits can be
lifted on this cold, overcast day.
You can hear chanting in the distance...&

Already you can feel the
power of the %tem sanctuary,
thawing your frigid body,
brightening your spirits which
have grown dark as the cloud
filled sky...&

Strange sounds and smells
meet you as you leave the cold,
cloudy winter's day: the incense's
bittersweet aroma is new to
your senses and the clergy of %tem
sing solemnly in a language dead
for many eons...&

#0003j
You enter the %tem and a
chill spring breeze follows you,
bringing with it the smell of
fresh air. You can hear chanting in
the distance...&

It is bright and fresh in
the %tem sanctuary as the spring
day outside. In the distance, you
can hear the chanting of the
clergy.&

The smell of the fresh arctic air
of spring that came into
the %tem sanctuary with you mixes
with the slightly spicy smell of incense.
You can hear the clergy far
away, giving a pray of thanksgiving for
the beauty of the new year.&

#0003k
You enter the %tem, shaking
the cool rain off of yourself.
You can hear chanting in the distance...&

Trailing puddles of warm
spring rain behind you, you enter
the %tem sanctuary. An open
window lets the smell of the storm
in, overpowering the sweet
incense of the %tem itself.&

Wiping the cool rain from
your shoulders and head, you walk
into the %tem sanctuary. Off to
the distance, you can hear the
clergy, prayer in a sing-song
for a good planting season for the farmers...&

#0003l
You enter the %tem wishing
that the sun would return and make
the day a truly pleasant one.
You can hear chanting in the distance...&

You walk into the %tem,
smelling the sweet incense that
rises like a cloud from the
sanctuary floor. In the distance,
you hear the clergy praying
for a return of the sun to this
dreary and cold spring day...&

You enter the %tem, gray as
this spring day sky. Almost immediately the bittersweet
smell of the incense strengthens your spirit.
The clergy drone their prayers far off in the distance.&

#0004a
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the summer glare. Many
items of interest hang on the
walls and in the
display case in front of you...&

The interior of %en is neat
and well organized. You wipe
the sweat from your brow and look
over the weapons and gear...&

It is a relief to enter the
%en, out of the chill wind and blinding
summer sunshine. Various supplies
are carefully arranged
throughout the store for your
browsing convenience...&

#0004b
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the summer rain. The cool
shade causes shivers to run over
your damp body. Many items of
interest hang on the walls and
in the display
case in front of you...&

The interior of %en is
spotlessly clean and neat. You
feel almost embarrassed to be
dripping puddles of cold rain
water all over as you glance
over the gear and weapon
displays...&

Wiping the cold water from
the summer shower off your head,
you enter %en. A display case
of the more popular supplies is featured in the small room.&

#0004c
You walk into %en. Many
items of interest hang on the
walls and in the
display case in front of you...&

%en is a refuge from the
windy summer day. In the
display case and all along the
walls are supplies and weaponry
for sale...&

You enter %en from the
overcast summer day. You browse
over the items displayed throughout
the store and are impressed by the variety...&

#0004d
As you enter %en, golden
glints from the fall sun
reflect off of the many items
of interest scattered about...&

You enter %en from the sunny
autumn day. Cases of weaponry
are featured next to some of the
more peaceful supplies and gear...&

The strangely pleasant autumn weather
has given %en an air of
joviality. You browse through
cases and displays of various supplies...&

#0004e
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the cold shower. As you dry
off you notice the many items of interest that hang on the
walls and in the display
case in front of you...&

You are handed a towel as
you come into %en from the
autumn thunderstorm. There is a
new shipment of weaponry and other gear,
and you notice several pieces worth
looking at...&

You are dripping with cold
rain water as you enter %en. It
is a neat and clean chamber with
a wide assortment of supplies and
weapons...&

#0004f
You enter %en rubbing your
hands together to warm them from
the chill. Many items of
interest hang on the walls and are
displayed in the display case in front of
you...&

It is a miserable autumn day
outside, and it is good to get
inside %en. You glance over the
new shipments of supplies and weaponry.&

It is a bit strange this time of year
to get warmer weather, but new
supplies of gear and armaments arrived at %en
with the warmth. You find a few
useful items immediately...&

#0004g
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the cold and bright
winter's day. Many items of
interest hang on the walls and
in the display
case in front of you...&

%en is as bright as the
winter day outside and much
colder. Several pieces of weaponry
and equipment look interesting
to you...&

You walk into %en, rubbing
your numb hands together. At least
it is sunny outside. Many new
weapons and supplies impress
you enough for a closer
look...&

#0004h
You enter %en, stamping your
feet to warm them and shaking
the frozen snow from your
shoulders. Many items of interest
hang on the walls and are
displayed in the display case in
front of you...&

A warm fire in %en thaws
your frozen body. You notice several
supplies in the display case and along
the walls that just might be useful...&

You let a spray of snow and
wind into %en as you enter.
Still, with the exception of the puddle by the door, the
chamber is neat and tidy. The walls and
display cases are fully stocked
with all varieties of weaponry and supplies...&

#0004i
You enter %en. Outside the
sun is hidden behind a thick
gray layer of clouds, dropping the temperature and making your
body steam in the warmth of the shopkeeper's hearth. Many items of
interest hang on the walls and
in the display
case in front of you...&

You are quickly given a cup
of warm cider as you enter %en,
which you accept gratefully, happy
to be inside on such a gloomy
winter's day. You look over the weaponry and other
merchandise proudly displayed in a case and all along the walls.&

The dog days of winter are
certainly here. You enter %en,
hoping for a deal or two on a
couple essential pieces of
equipment. Several things
immediately attract your attention
as you look over the display
case and the assortments along
the walls...&

#0004j
You enter %en and bring with
you a chill spring breeze that
ruffles many of the items of
interest hanging on the walls.
There are more items displayed in
the display case in front of
you...&

It is a beautiful spring day
outside, and the mood of the
clerks in %en is bright. Perhaps
you can get a good deal off
them on a couple of items that
impress you...&

An open window in %en brings
in the smell of spring flowers
as you look over your money to
see what you can afford. There are several displayed items
that might prove useful...&

#0004k
You enter %en, happy to be
out of the cool spring shower.
Many items of interest hang on
the walls and in the display case in front of
you...&

It looks like a new shipment
of weaponry and other supplies
arrived in %en at the same time
the rain picked up outside. You
notice several items of interest...&

You wipe the cool spring
rain from your shoulders and head
as you enter %en. Most of the
items within are meant more for the townsmen
than you, but you do see some
adventuring equipment...&

#0004l
You enter %en, hoping that
the sun will show itself again.
There are many items of interest hanging
on the walls and displayed in the
display case in front
of you...&

There is a window open in
%en: the clerks are apparently
hoping for some fresh scents of
spring air to brighten a gray day.
Several weapons and supplies on
display might be helpful to you...&

It is a cold and overcast
day, and you doubt that the clerks
in %en are in the mood to barter.
You check your money supply as
you browse through the store's
wares...&

#1501
As you approach the Palace Gates a guard
respectfully bows and informs you that
due to the catastrophic forces unleashed
during the final conflict with the Imperial
Battle Mage, the Palace is currently under
reconstruction. Perhaps, he suggests, you could
return once the repairs are complete...&
